<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000195">Set on the island of Lesbos, <em>Daphnis and Chloe</em> is the oldest surviving romantic novel. Written in the second century <span class="small_caps">AD</span> by Longus, it tells of two youngsters who fall in love but who are so innocent they do not understand what is happening or what to do about it. It is not until Chloe starts searching for the words to describe Daphnis’ beauty that she even begins to fall in love with him.</p>
<p id="tec0000196">‘[W]hen a word is properly defined,’ Simone Weil wrote in 1937, it helps ‘us to grasp some concrete reality or concrete objective, or method of activity. To clarify thought, to discredit the intrinsically meaningless words, and to define the use of others by precise analysis – to do this, strange though it may appear, might be a way of saving human lives.’<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter005_en_1" id="chapter005_en1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></p>
<p id="tec0000197">It is tempting to think that it does not really matter what we call the system we live in. Technofeudalism or hyper-capitalism, the system is what it is, whatever the word we use to describe it. Tempting perhaps, but quite wrong. Reserving the word ‘fascist’ for regimes that genuinely fall into that category and refraining from using it to describe regimes that, however nasty are not fascist, matters hugely. Calling a viral outbreak a pandemic can prove vital in mobilising against it. Similarly with the global system we live in today: the word we use to describe it can influence profoundly whether we are more likely to perpetuate and reproduce it or whether we might challenge or even overthrow it.</p>
<p id="tec0000198">Suppose we were living in the 1770s, as the first steam <span aria-label="117" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg117" role="doc-pagebreak"/>engines began driving the water pumps that kept the mines dry and turning the wheels of William Blake’s ‘dark satanic mills’. As their chimneys spewed thick smoke along the River Clyde, in Birmingham and around Manchester, we would not be wrong to speak of an emergent ‘industrial feudalism’ or ‘market feudalism’. Technically, we would be correct.</p>
<p id="tec0000199">In the 1770s, and for at least another century, wherever one looked one saw feudalism. Feudal lords dominated rural areas, owned the freehold titles of most city blocks, commanded armies and navies, and presided over parliamentary committees and government bodies. Even in the 1840s, as Marx and Engels were writing their manifesto in response to the worldwide effects of the capitalist class, most production was still taking place under the auspices of the old feudalist class, the landed gentry. Land ownership remained the main source of political authority and rent continued to be more powerful than profit, especially in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars when landlords regained the upper hand over capitalists by banning grain imports with their Corn Laws.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter005_en_2" id="chapter005_en2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></p>
<p id="tec0000200">And yet something critically important would have been lost if those who forged the language of that era had been reluctant to ditch the word feudalism, choosing to call the nascent system not capitalism but industrial or market feudalism. By boldly calling it capitalism, a century before capital had fully dominated our societies, they opened humanity’s eyes to the great transformation unfolding around them as it was happening.</p>
<p id="tec0000201">Wherever we look today we see capitalism. Capitalists continue to own almost everything and run the military-industrial complex. They dominate parliaments, government bodies, the media, central banks and all of the powerful global institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World <span aria-label="118" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg118" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Bank, the Paris Club and the World Trade Organization. Markets continue to rule the lives and shape the minds and imaginations of billions. Profit remains the holy grail for the masses struggling to get by, as well as those wealthy individuals who believe in profit-making as an end in itself. And just as the Napoleonic Wars gave feudal power a second wind, so the war in Ukraine and its inflationary effects is reviving the fortunes of terrestrial capital, even the moribund fossil fuel industry. And yet, just as in the 1770s, to describe today’s nascent system in the terms of the past – to call it hyper-capitalism, or platform capitalism, or rentier capitalism – would be not just a failure of the imagination but to miss the great transformation of <em>our</em> society that is currently taking place.</p>
<p id="tec0000202">We have seen how with the enclosure of the internet commons, cloud capital arose, and how it differs from other kinds of capital in its ability to reproduce itself at no expense to its owner, turning all of us into cloud serfs. We have seen how with the shift online, Amazon now operates as a cloud fief, with traditional business paying Jeff Bezos to operate as his vassals. And we have seen how the cloudalists of Big Tech achieved all this: riding on the wave of central bank money that made profits optional. At the end of the previous chapter, we considered two immediate outcomes: the ever-rising value of the PropComs of this world has allowed private equity to asset-strip whatever they can lay their hands on, while the Big Three have established a kind of collective monopoly power over entire sectors of industry. So what, in essence, has changed? What in the simplest possible terms distinguishes this world from the previous one, demanding that we discard the word capitalism and replace it with technofeudalism? As I touched on at the end of the last chapter, it is very simply this: the triumph of rent over profit.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000203"><em><span aria-label="119" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg119" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Rent’s revenge: how profit succumbed to cloud rent</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000204">What would it take for capitalism to die? In your youth you had a definitive answer: capitalism will die, like Dr Frankenstein, indirectly of its own hand, a deserving victim of its greatest creation: the proletariat. Capitalism, you were convinced, was creating two great camps destined to clash: capitalists, who did not physically work with the revolutionary technologies they owned; and the proletarians who spent their days and nights working in, on, under or with these technological wonders, from merchant ships and railways to tractors, conveyor belts and industrial robots. The revolutionary technologies were no threat to capitalism. But revolutionary workers who knew how to work these incredible machines were.</p>
<p id="tec0000205">The more capital dominated the global economic and political sphere the closer the two camps got to facing off one another in a critical battle. At its conclusion, and for the first time on a planetary scale, good would vanquish evil. The bitter bifurcation of humanity, between owners and non-owners, would thus be healed. Values would no longer be reducible to prices. And humankind would, at last, be reconciled with itself, turning technology from its master to its servant.</p>
<p id="tec0000206">In practical terms, your vision meant the birth of a proper, technologically advanced, socialist democracy. Collectively owned capital and land would be pressed into producing the things society needs. Managers would be answerable to the employees that elected them, to their customers, to society as a whole. Profit would wither as a driving force because the distinction between profit and wages would no longer make sense: every employee would be an equal shareholder, their pay coming out of their enterprise’s net revenues. The <span aria-label="120" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg120" role="doc-pagebreak"/>simultaneous death of the market for shares and of the labour market would turn banking into a staid, utility-like sector. Markets and concentrated wealth would, consequently, lose their brutish power over communities, allowing us collectively to decide how to provide health, education and protection of the environment.</p>
<p id="tec0000207">Things could not have panned out more differently. Even in Western countries, like Germany and for a time Britain, where national labour unions grew strong, waged labour failed to organise effectively and eventually acquiesced to the idea of capitalism as a ‘natural’ system. Solidarity between the workers of the North and the South remains an entirely unfulfilled dream. Capital has simply gone from strength to strength. And in places where revolutions sworn to your vision succeeded, life ended up sooner or later resembling a cross between George Orwell’s <em>Animal Farm</em> and <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>. I shall never forget you confessing to me, while recounting horror stories of the years you spent in prison camps for Greek left-wingers, the feeling which overwhelmed you most: that, had our side won power, you would probably be in the same prison only with different guards. It resonated with the heartbreak of authentic left-wingers worldwide: good people, dedicated to your vision, who ended up in gulags guarded by former comrades or, even worse, in positions of the sort of power that their own ideology detested.</p>
<p id="tec0000208">Nevertheless, your prognosis is holding up extremely well, though not in ways that you would welcome. Capitalism <em>is</em> dying indirectly of its own hand, a deserving victim of its greatest creation: not the proletariat, but the cloudalists. And little by little, capitalism’s two great pillars – profit and markets – are being replaced. Alas, instead of a post-capitalist system that finally heals human divisions and ends <span aria-label="121" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg121" role="doc-pagebreak"/>exploitation of people and planet, the one that is taking shape deepens and universalises exploitation in ways that were hitherto unimaginable, except perhaps by science-fiction writers. Thinking back, Dad, why did we ever allow ourselves to be lured into the soothing delusion that the death of something bad would necessarily deliver something better? Rosa Luxemburg’s devastating question ‘Socialism or barbarism?’<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter005_en_3" id="chapter005_en3" role="doc-noteref">3</a> was not rhetorical. Its answer could easily be barbarism – or extinction.</p>
<p id="tec0000209">What we need, then, is a new story that explains not what we wish would happen but what is actually happening, and that is the story of how rent – the defining economic trait of feudalism – staged its remarkable comeback.</p>
<p id="tec0000210">Under feudalism, rent was easy enough to grasp. Courtesy of some accident of birth, or royal decree, the feudal lord obtained the deeds to a plot of land which empowered him to extract part of the harvest produced by the peasants who had been born and raised on that land. Under capitalism, grasping the meaning of rent, and distinguishing it from profit, is much harder – a difficulty I witnessed first-hand when as a university teacher I would struggle to help my students spot the difference between the two.</p>
<p id="tec0000211">Arithmetically, there is no difference: both rent and profit amount to money left over once costs are paid for. The difference is subtler, qualitative, almost abstract: profit is vulnerable to market competition, rent is not. The reason is their different origins. Rent flows from privileged access to things in fixed supply, like fertile soil or land containing fossil fuels; you cannot produce more of these resources, however much money you might invest in them. Profit, in contrast, flows into the pockets of entrepreneurial people who have invested in things that would not have otherwise existed – things like <span aria-label="122" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg122" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Edison’s light bulb or Jobs’s iPhone. It is this fact – that these commodities were invented and created and so can be invented and created again but better by someone else – that renders profit vulnerable to competition.</p>
<p id="tec0000212">When Sony invented the Walkman, the first mobile and personal hi-fi, it raked in substantial profits. Then competition from imitators whittled Sony’s profits away until, eventually, Apple rode in with its iPod to dominate the market. In contrast, market competition is the rentier’s friend. If Jack owns a building in a neighbourhood that is being gentrified as a result of what others do, Jack’s rents will increase even if he does nothing – he, literally, gets wealthier in his sleep. The more enterprising Jack’s neighbours are, and the more they invest in the area, the larger his rents.</p>
<p id="tec0000213">Capitalism prevailed when profit overwhelmed rent, a historic triumph coinciding with the transformation of productive work and property rights into commodities to be sold via labour and share markets respectively. It was not just an economic victory. Whereas rent reeked of vulgar exploitation, profit claimed moral superiority as a just reward to brave entrepreneurs risking everything to navigate the treacherous currents of stormy markets. Nevertheless, despite profit’s triumph, rent survived capitalism’s golden age in the same way that remnants of the DNA of our ancient ancestors, including long-extinct serpents and microbes, survive in human DNA.</p>
<p id="tec0000214">Capitalist mega-firms, like Ford, Edison, General Electric, General Motors, ThyssenKrupp, Volkswagen, Toyota, Sony and all the others, generated the profits that outweighed rent and propelled capitalism to its dominance. However, like remora fish living parasitically in the shadow of great sharks, some rentiers not only survived but, in fact, flourished by <span aria-label="123" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg123" role="doc-pagebreak"/>feeding on the generous scraps left in profit’s wake. Oil companies, for example, have raked in gargantuan ground rents from the right to drill on particular plots of land or ocean beds – not to mention the unearned privilege to damage the planet at no cost to themselves.</p>
<p id="tec0000215">Naturally, oil companies have attempted to legitimise their loot by presenting it as capitalist profit, exaggerating the extent to which their returns are a reward to investments in smart, low-cost drilling technology without which, it is true, the extracted oil might not be competitive with oil extracted by competing oil producers. The same is true of real estate development where ground rent overshadows any profit from innovative architecture. Or with privatised electricity or water utilities whose returns are mostly due to rents the political class has allocated to them. What all these mega-rentiers have in common is a strong motive to legitimise their rents by disguising them as profits – something akin to profit-washing their rents.</p>
<p id="tec0000216">After the Second World War, rent went one better than merely surviving capitalism: it staged a revival on the coat-tails of the emergent technostructure – the nexus of conglomerates with immense resources, productive capacity and market reach that grew out of the War Economy. The innovative marketeers and imaginative advertisers employed by the technostructure achieved this by creating something ingenious: brand loyalty.</p>
<p id="tec0000217">Brand loyalty affords the brand owner the power to raise prices without losing customers. This price premium reflects the greater status afforded to the owner of a Mercedes-Benz or an Apple computer over the owner of, say, a cheaper equivalent produced by Ford or Sony. These premiums amount to brand rents. By the 1980s, branding had attained <span aria-label="124" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg124" role="doc-pagebreak"/>such rent-extracting powers that young, aspiring entrepreneurs cared less about who produced things, where or how than they did about owning the right brands.</p>
<p id="tec0000218">If branding gave rent its first chance to flourish again in the 1950s, the emergence of cloud capital in the noughties was rent’s opportunity to exact a stunning revenge on profit – to stage a comeback for the ages. Apple played a leading role in this. Before the iPhone, Steve Jobs’s gadgets were a textbook case of high-end commodities that fetched premium prices reflecting substantial brand rents – not unlike Rolls-Royces and Prada shoes. The company survived brutal competition from Microsoft, IBM, Sony and an army of lesser competitors by selling desktops, laptops and iPods with beautiful design and famed user-friendliness that ultimately allowed Apple to charge significant amounts of brand rent. However, the breakthrough for Apple, which turned it into a trillion-dollar company, was the iPhone – not just because it was a great mobile phone but because it handed Apple the key to a whole new treasure chest: cloud rent.</p>
<p id="tec0000219">The stroke of genius that unlocked cloud rent for Steve Jobs was his radical idea to invite ‘third-party developers’ to use free Apple software with which to produce applications for sale via the Apple Store. In one fell swoop Apple had created an army of unwaged labourers and vassal capitalists whose hard work yielded a host of capabilities available exclusively to iPhone owners in the form of thousands of desirable apps that Apple engineers could never have produced themselves in such variety or volume.</p>
<p id="tec0000220">Suddenly, an iPhone was much more than a desirable phone. It was a ticket to a vast vista of pleasures and abilities that no other smartphone company could provide. Even if an Apple competitor, say Nokia, Sony or Blackberry, had <span aria-label="125" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg125" role="doc-pagebreak"/>managed to respond quickly by manufacturing a smarter, faster, cheaper and more beautiful phone, it would not matter: only an iPhone opened the gates to the Apple Store. Why didn’t Nokia, Sony or Blackberry build their own store? Because it was too late: with so many people signed up to Apple, the thousands of third-party developers were not going to spend their time and effort developing apps for other platforms. To be competitive, Apple’s unwaged third-party developers, mainly partnerships or small capitalist firms, had no choice but to operate via the Apple Store. The price? A 30 per cent ground rent, paid to Apple on all their revenues. Thus a vassal capitalist class grew from the fertile soil of the first cloud fief: the Apple Store.</p>
<p id="tec0000221">Only one other conglomerate managed to persuade a significant proportion of those developers to create apps for its own store: Google. Long before the iPhone arrived, Google’s search engine had become the centrepiece of a cloud empire which included Gmail and YouTube, and which would later include Google Drive, Google Maps and a host of other online services. Keen to exploit its already dominant cloud capital, Google followed a different strategy to Apple’s. Instead of manufacturing a handset in competition with the iPhone, it developed Android – an operating system that could be installed for free on the smartphone of any manufacturer, including Sony, Blackberry and Nokia, who chose to use it. The idea was that if enough of Apple’s competitors installed it on their phones, the pool of smartphones operating on the Android software would be large enough to lure third-party developers to produce apps not only for the Apple Store but also for a new store running on Android software. That’s how Google created Google Play, the only serious alternative to the Apple Store.</p>
<p id="tec0000222"><span aria-label="126" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg126" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Android was neither better nor worse than the operating system Sony, Blackberry, Nokia and others had – or could have – produced on their own. But it came with a superpower: Google’s abundant cloud capital, which acted as a magnet to the third-party developers Sony, Blackberry, Nokia could never have attracted on their own. How could they resist? However reluctantly, they were forced to accept the role of vassal capitalist phone manufacturers, subsisting on scraps of profit from selling their hardware, while Google raked in the cloud rent produced by that other crowd of vassal privateers and capitalists: the third-party developers now producing apps for sale on Google Play.</p>
<p id="tec0000223">The result was a global smartphone industry with two dominant cloudalist corporations, Apple and Google, with the bulk of their wealth being produced by unwaged third-party developers, from whose sales they extracted a fixed cut. This is not profit. It is cloud rent, the digital equivalent of ground rent.</p>
<p id="tec0000224">During this same decade, Amazon perfected its own formula for selling physical goods via a global supply chain through its own cloud fief – amazon.com – whose dynamics we have already examined. Thanks to Amazon’s algorithmically driven ecommerce formula, cloud rent was no longer confined to the digital world.</p>
<p id="tec0000225">Funded by central bank money, bolstered by private equity, these cloudalists extended their cloud fiefs across the globe, extracting gargantuan cloud rents from vassal capitalists and cloud serfs alike. In a paradoxical twist, the number of capitalists relying on good old-fashioned profit <em>grew</em> even while their profit margins and power declined. Likewise, these vassal capitalists have continued to enjoy the power to command labour from the majority who are reliant on wages, and they continue to own at least some of their means of production: <span aria-label="127" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg127" role="doc-pagebreak"/>their computers, their cars and vans, perhaps an office, warehouse or factory. Indeed, not all vassal capitalists are small-scale artisans, some are large capitalist manufacturers. But large or small, powerful or otherwise, all vassal capitalists are by definition dependent to a greater or lesser extent on selling their wares via an ecommerce site, whether Amazon or eBay or Alibaba, with a sizeable portion of their net earnings being skimmed off by the cloudalists they depend on.</p>
<p id="tec0000226">Meanwhile, as Amazon was snaring makers of physical products within its cloud fief, other cloudalists were focusing their attention on the precariat. Companies like Uber, Lyft, Grubhub, DoorDash and Instacart in the Global North, along with their imitators in Asia and Africa, wired into their cloud fiefs a vast array of drivers, delivery people, cleaners, restaurateurs – even dog walkers – collecting from these unwaged, piece-rate workers a fixed cut of their earnings, too. A cloud rent.</p>
<p id="tec0000227">Recently, I watched the Super 8 silent home movies you left me in a carton at the Paleo Phaliro house, many of which you had filmed during your travels in the 1960s when, at the drop of a hat, the steel company you worked for would fly you to America, Japan and Europe to buy advanced machinery, or to the West’s former colonies to secure a steady supply of high-quality iron ore and coking coal. One film reel I found was marked ‘1964 – Indonesia’. Most of the footage was of a road trip out of Jakarta. On mile after mile of crowded country road, I could not fail to notice the roadside <em>warungs</em> around which scores of locals congregated. <em>Warungs</em>, you explained, are like our kiosks in Greece, selling cheaply everything from drinks, pens and newspapers to shampoo, aspirin and telephone services.</p>
<p id="tec0000228">You might be surprised to hear that Bukalapak, an <span aria-label="128" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg128" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Indonesian cloudalist firm, is taking over three and a half million <em>warungs</em>, digitising their services with a view not only to uploading their multifaceted local markets to the cloud but also to financialising the local communities who depend on them via usurious micro-credits, expensive digital cash transfers and basic banking services. Never too slow to cotton on, Jeff Bezos dispatched Jeff Bezos Expeditions to Indonesia and in 2021 began to invest in a competitor of Bukalapak’s.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter005_en_4" id="chapter005_en4" role="doc-noteref">4</a> Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, early investor in Facebook, initiator of Palantir, has done the same with his Valar Ventures. So have Tencent, a leading Chinese Big Tech conglomerate.</p>
<p id="tec0000229">From factory owners in America’s Midwest to poets struggling to sell their latest anthology, from London Uber drivers to Indonesian street hawkers, all are now dependent on some cloud fief for access to customers. It is progress, of sorts. Gone is the time when, to collect their rent, feudal lords employed thugs to break their vassals’ knees or spill their blood. The cloudalists don’t need to deploy bailiffs to confiscate or to evict. Instead, every vassal capitalist knows that with the removal of a link from their cloud vassal’s site they could lose access to the bulk of their customers. And with the removal of a link or two from Google’s search engine or from a couple of ecommerce and social media sites, they could disappear from the online world altogether. A sanitised tech-terror is the bedrock of technofeudalism.</p>
<p id="tec0000230">Looked at in totality, it becomes apparent that the world economy is lubricated less and less with profit and increasingly with cloud rent. And so the delightful antinomy of our era comes into focus: capitalist activity is growing within the same process of energetic capital accumulation that degrades capitalist profit and gradually replaces capitalist markets with <span aria-label="129" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg129" role="doc-pagebreak"/>cloud fiefs. In short, capitalism is withering as a result of burgeoning capitalist activity. It is through capitalist activity that technofeudalism was born and is now sweeping to power. After all, how could it be any other way?</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000231"><em>Capitalism on steroids?</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000232">‘I am unconvinced,’ I hear you say. ‘Feudal lords never invested in anything except intrigue and violence. Your cloudalists, in contrast, invest massively in the highest of high-tech capital. They are the epitome of capitalists, pouring money into research and development in order to produce new and desirable commodities like search results, digital personal assistants and teleconferencing applications. Even if they manage to create something resembling a fiefdom, as Zuckerberg did with Facebook, a competitor emerges before long who syphons off millions of users to their own multibillion-dollar business. Look at the sudden rise of TikTok, for example!</p>
<p id="tec0000233">‘Your cloudalists are the polar opposite of lazy barons and earls and far closer to Thomas Edison, Henry Ford and George Westinghouse than any feudal lord. If anything, Yanis, they are capitalists on steroids – and in the final analysis, even if they feast more and more on what you call cloud rent, what they are doing is still capitalism. Call it rentier capitalism. Or cloud capitalism. Or hyper-capitalism. But technofeudalism? No, I don’t see it.’</p>
<p id="tec0000234">It is true, Dad, that the cloudalists are – or at least were – capitalists-on-steroids. That I would never dispute. Unlike the feudalists, who were invariably born with the power to extract rents, the cloudalists had to create it from scratch. And to do that, you’re right, they invested gargantuan sums <span aria-label="130" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg130" role="doc-pagebreak"/>in their technology. But the question remains: what exactly did they invest in? And what came of their investments?</p>
<p id="tec0000235">You say that the cloudalists invested in the creation of new commodities – but a commodity is a thing or service produced to be sold for profit. Search results are not produced to be sold. Alexa and Siri do not answer our questions for a fee. Like Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp, their purpose is entirely different: to capture and modify our attention. And even when Big Tech cloudalists make us pay a fee to gain access to artificial intelligence bots like ChatGPT or sell us physical devices such as Alexa, they aren’t selling them as commodities. These gadgets are leased or sold cheaply not for the negligible (often negative) profit they make on them but to gain access to our homes and, via them, to more of our attention. It is this power over our attention that allows them to collect cloud rent from the vassal capitalists who are in the old-fashioned business of selling <em>their</em> commodities. Ultimately, the cloudalist’s investment is aimed not at competing within a capitalist market but in getting us to <em>exit</em> capitalist markets altogether.</p>
<p id="tec0000236">Cloudalists like Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Sergei Brin do, I admit, have some things in common with Edison, Ford and Westinghouse: big egos, oversized companies, and a readiness to break things, including existing markets and state institutions, in order to shore up their dominance. But those captains of early-twentieth-century Big Business were all focused squarely on achieving profit by monopolising markets and deploying the capital of factories and production lines. They would be the first to see that the cloudalists are now becoming fabulously wealthy without needing to organise the production of <em>any</em> commodity. Not only that, they are free from the pressure of a market to <span aria-label="131" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg131" role="doc-pagebreak"/>produce cheaper, better commodities or indeed the constant fear that a competitor might come up with a product that steals their market share altogether.</p>
<p id="tec0000237">‘But your cloudalists do live in such fear,’ I hear you object. ‘Look at how TikTok drained Facebook’s users and revenues. Or at the existential threat to Netflix that is Disney Plus. Or at how Walmart’s ecommerce site has been taking market share from Amazon. Isn’t this exactly the market competition that Ford, Edison and Westinghouse faced?’</p>
<p id="tec0000238">Well, Dad, despite the similarities, no, it’s not.</p>
<p id="tec0000239">Battles and rivalries like these, leading to the rise and fall of fiefs, were part and parcel of feudalism. At times, it took considerable effort to keep fiefs from falling into decline or conquest, especially after 1350 when the Black Death created acute labour shortages and serfs were able to leave one fief and migrate to another. But we should not confuse rivalry between fiefs with market-based competition.</p>
<p id="tec0000240">TikTok’s success at stealing the attention of users away from other social media sites is not due to the lower prices it offers or higher quality of the ‘friendships’ or associations it enables. TikTok created a new cloud fief for cloud serfs in search of a different online experience to migrate to. Disney Plus did not offer audiences the movies and series on Netflix at lower prices or in higher definition formats – it offered movies and series not available on Netflix. Walmart did not undercut Amazon’s prices or improve on the quality of its commodities – it used its own database to lure more users to its newly established cloud fief. As for Apple, the pioneer of cloud-fief construction, it deploys what it calls ‘privacy rules’ (e.g. it prevents competitors, like Facebook and Google, from gleaning iPhone owners’ data) that are carefully tailored to prevent other cloudalists from modifying the <span aria-label="132" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg132" role="doc-pagebreak"/>behaviour of any users that they share, causing Mark Zuckerberg to accuse it of charging ‘monopoly rents’ and ‘stifling innovation’.</p>
<p id="tec0000241">Like Ford, Edison and Westinghouse, the cloudalists of Amazon, Tencent, Alibaba, Facebook, Apple and Google also invest in research and development, in politics, marketing, union-busting and cartel tactics, but again they do so not to sell commodities at maximum profit, but in order to extract maximum rents from the capitalists who do.</p>
<p id="tec0000242">The Great Transformation, from feudalism to capitalism, was predicated on the usurpation of rent by profit as the driving force of our socio-economic system. That was why the word <em>capitalism</em> proved so much more useful and insightful than a term like market feudalism. It is this fundamental fact – that we have entered a socio-economic system powered not by profit but by rent – that demands we use a new term to describe it. To think of it as hyper-capitalism or rentier capitalism would be to miss this essential, defining principle. And to reflect the return of rent to its central role, I can think of no better name than technofeudalism.</p>
<p id="tec0000243">More importantly, having defined and labelled it properly, I believe we are now better equipped to grasp the meaning and importance of this systemic transformation – and what is at stake for us all.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000244"><em>The technofeudal method to Elon Musk’s Twitter madness</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000245">If I had to choose one person to illustrate the need for technofeudalism, both word and concept, in order to understand our collective predicament, it would be Elon Musk.</p>
<p id="tec0000246">Brilliant and flawed, combining rare engineering talents <span aria-label="133" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg133" role="doc-pagebreak"/>with ridiculous public displays of ostentation, Musk is our era’s Thomas Edison – the man who, you may recall, electrocuted an elephant in order to discredit a rival. Having revolutionised industries that are normally the graveyard of upstarts, from car manufacturing to space travel and even brain-computer interfaces, Musk proceeded to spend tens of billions of dollars on buying Twitter, risking in the process everything he had achieved as a manufacturer and engineer. Many commentators opined that Musk was just another rich brat looking for an even more impressive toy than the ones he had already. But there was a logic to his purchase of Twitter: a technofeudal logic that elucidates much more than Musk’s mindset.</p>
<p id="tec0000247">We should not be surprised if Musk was indeed feeling unfulfilled. For all his success as manufacturer, and despite attaining richest-man-in-the-world status, neither his achievements nor his wealth granted him entry into the new ruling class. His Tesla car company uses the cloud cleverly to turn its cars into nodes on a digital network that generates Big Data and ties drivers to Musk’s systems. His SpaceX rocket company, and the flock of satellites it pollutes our planet’s low orbit periphery with, contributes significantly to the development of other moguls’ cloud capital. But Musk? Frustratingly for the business world’s <em>enfant terrible</em>, he has lacked a gateway to the gigantic rents that cloud capital can furnish. Twitter could be that missing gateway.</p>
<p id="tec0000248">Immediately after taking over Twitter, Musk spoke of his commitment to safeguarding Twitter as the ‘public square’ where we debate anything and everything. It was a bit of propaganda which successfully diverted the public’s attention towards an endless global debate about whether the world should trust its foremost short-form debating forum <span aria-label="134" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg134" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to a mogul with a history of playing fast and loose with the truth on that same forum. While the liberal commentariat was fretting over Donald Trump’s reinstatement, decent people admonished the terrible treatment of Twitter’s employees, and the left agonised over the rise of a tech-savvy version of Rupert Murdoch, Musk was keeping his eye on the ball. In a revealing tweet, he admitted his ambition to turn Twitter into an ‘everything app’.</p>
<p id="tec0000249">What did he mean by an ‘everything app’? He meant nothing less than a gateway to technofeudalism, one that would allow him to attract users’ attention, modify their consumer behaviour, extract free labour from them as cloud serfs and, last but not least, charge vendors cloud rent for selling them their wares. Unlike the owners of Amazon, Google, Alibaba, Facebook, TikTok and Tencent, Musk did not own anything capable of evolving into an ‘everything app’ and had no way of creating one from scratch. Only one such interface belonged to no other mogul or hyper-corporation and was, therefore, available for purchase: Twitter.</p>
<p id="tec0000250">As a private fief, Twitter could never be the world’s public square. The pertinent question is whether Musk can use it to build a prominent cloud fief and, thus, gain membership of the new technofeudal ruling class: the cloudalists. That will depend on whether he can successfully enhance Twitter’s cloud capital, perhaps by hooking it up to his existing Big Data network that is constantly being enriched by his cars and satellites. Succeed or fail, Musk’s Twitter escapade shows how technofeudalism and the perspective it affords help us better to understand what is actually going on in our world.</p>
<p id="tec0000251">That is one particular example, whose outcome will be relatively limited. But technofeudalism also unlocks a more pervasive and pressing problem, in which we are all implicated.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000252"><em><span aria-label="135" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg135" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The technofeudal underpinnings of the Great Inflation</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000253">Every great transformation brings with it a new type of crisis. When we invented agriculture, we amassed plants and animals within our communities and, unwittingly, bred noxious germs that caused hideous epidemics. The arrival of capitalism begat economic crises such as the Great Depression. Today, technofeudalism is deepening pre-existing sources of instability and turning them into new existential threats. Specifically, the Great Inflation and cost-of-living crisis that have followed the recent pandemic cannot be properly understood outside the context of technofeudalism.</p>
<p id="tec0000254">In the last chapter, I recounted how for twelve long years after the crash of 2008, central banks printed trillions to replace the bankers’ losses. We saw how socialism for bankers and austerity for the rest of us dampened investment, blunted Western capitalism’s dynamic and pushed it into a state of gilded stagnation. The only serious investment of the central banks’ poisoned money during this time went into the accumulation of cloud capital. By 2020, cloud rents accruing to cloud capital accounted for much of the developed world’s aggregate net income. That in brief is how cloud rent gained the upper hand and profit retreated.</p>
<p id="tec0000255">One does not need to be left-leaning to know that rent’s stunning comeback could only mean deeper and more toxic stagnation.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter005_en_5" id="chapter005_en5" role="doc-noteref">5</a> Wages get spent by the many struggling to make ends meet. Profits get invested in capital goods to maintain the capitalists’ capacity to profit. But rent is stashed away in property (mansions, yachts, art, cryptocurrencies, etc.) and stubbornly refuses to enter circulation, stimulate investment into useful things, and revive flaccid capitalist societies. And <span aria-label="136" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg136" role="doc-pagebreak"/>so a vicious cycle begins: deeper stagnation ensues, causing central banks to print more money, enabling more extraction and less investment, and so on.</p>
<p id="tec0000256">The pandemic exacerbated the same trend. The only significant difference from the pre-pandemic period was that, this time, and for the first time since 2008, some of the fresh trillions printed by central banks were spent by governments on the population, to keep their citizens alive while locked down. Nonetheless, most of the new monies ended up bolstering the share price of Big Tech corporations. This explains the report of Swiss bank UBS, published in October 2020, which found that billionaires had increased their wealth by more than a quarter (27.5 per cent) between April and July of that year, just as millions of people around the world lost their jobs or were struggling to get by on government schemes.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter005_en_6" id="chapter005_en6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></p>
<p id="tec0000257">Meanwhile, lockdowns closed ports, roads and airports, throttling the supply of goods in economies where, for many years, underinvestment had already depleted the capacity to produce locally. What happens when supply suddenly dies? Especially during times when the locked-down masses get some income support from the central banks’ money tree? The price of groceries, exercise bikes, bread makers, natural gas, petrol, housing and a host of other goods goes through the roof and, following a dozen years of subdued prices, a Great Inflation sets in.</p>
<p id="tec0000258">Many hoped that the inflation resulting from blockages in the supply chain would be mild. The expectation that inflation would be ‘transitory’ had a logic to it: workers’ bargaining power in the 2020s was a shadow of its former self, when in the 1970s mighty trades unions could push for wage rises above the inflation rate. It followed that with only limp wage rises to support them once government furlough schemes and income <span aria-label="137" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg137" role="doc-pagebreak"/>support came to an end, the purchasing power of the masses would simply be depleted by rising prices, demand for goods would ebb and prices would fall. It hasn’t panned out that way.</p>
<p id="tec0000259">Inflation is never just a monetary phenomenon – just as money is never just a token of exchange value. When, for whatever reason, prices surge across the board, a social power game is afoot in which everyone attempts to suss out their bargaining power. Business managers try to work out how far they can raise prices – if not to profit then, at least, to recoup their own rising costs. Rentiers, both traditional and cloudalist, test the water with rent hikes. Workers assess the extent to which they can push for a pay rise – at least to compensate for the higher bills they must meet. Governments play the game too: do they intervene by using the greater income and VAT tax receipts flowing from the rising prices to assist weaker citizens being crushed by inflation? Or do they subsidise Big Business as it is squeezed by high energy prices? Or do they do nothing much? Until these questions get answered, inflation continues to roll.</p>
<p id="tec0000260">In a power game like this, it is power that matters above all. If capital dominates labour, inflation ends when workers accept a permanent reduction in their wage share of total income. If government dominates capital, as for example in China, inflation dissipates when capitalists and rentiers acquiesce to a chunk of their loot being used to pay off a portion of the state’s deficits, debts or expenditures. The question, for us, then becomes: what happens in societies where cloud capital dominates terrestrial capital and labour is at the bottom of the pecking order?</p>
<p id="tec0000261">Two things happen – one obvious and one far less so. On the surface, supermarkets, energy companies and any other conglomerate that is able to inflate prices above its costs will <span aria-label="138" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg138" role="doc-pagebreak"/>rake in superprofits.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter005_en_7" id="chapter005_en7" role="doc-noteref">7</a> However, the less obvious but more interesting repercussion of the Great Inflation, in a world going through its early technofeudalist phase, is subtler and woven into society’s productive fabric: traditional capital is further displaced by new cloud capital, hastening and strengthening technofeudalism’s super-arching reach. Here are two examples of how it goes.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000262"><em>The case of German cars and green energy</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000263">German car makers were dealt a double blow by the Great Inflation: rising fuel prices not only put their customers off but elevated the energy cost of making cars. The German press went so far as to agonise over the country’s possible de-industrialisation. While their angst was justified, their analysis missed the point.</p>
<p id="tec0000264">German car makers will probably continue to produce as many cars in the future as they did in the past for the simple reason that they have been relatively swift to invest in the transition from manufacturing the petrol-powered automobiles of the past to the electric vehicles of our future. You might think, then, that the hastening of the shift to electric cars, caused by energy price inflation, would work in their favour. Not so much.</p>
<p id="tec0000265">The kernel of German capital’s power and success is high-precision mechanical and electrical engineering. German car makers, in particular, have profited by building high-quality internal combustion engines and all the parts that are necessary to convey motion from such engines to a car’s wheels: the gearboxes, axles, differentials and so on. Electric vehicles are mechanically much simpler to engineer. Most of their <span aria-label="139" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg139" role="doc-pagebreak"/>surplus value – and the profit they afford – derives from the software that runs them and connects the car to the cloud and the data that derives in turn from that. The Great Inflation, in other words, is forcing German industry to produce goods that rely a lot more on cloud capital than traditional capital.</p>
<p id="tec0000266">The problem, then, is this: compared to their American and Chinese counterparts, German capitalists failed to realise soon enough the benefits of investing in cloud capital – of becoming cloudalists – and lag far behind in this new game. In practical terms, they are manufacturing themselves out of a competitive position. Unable to collect sufficient cloud rents, German surpluses will suffer and so will the economy of a European Union – and its citizenry – reliant on German surpluses.</p>
<p id="tec0000267">A similar story can be told about the energy sector. Once the pandemic receded and energy prices surged, Big Oil and Gas made a fortune. The fossil fuel industry has had a second wind, similar to that enjoyed by landowners during the Napoleonic Wars, due to the disruption of corn imports into Britain. But second winds do not last long. Just as capitalist profit overcame the short-term revival of feudal lords’ fortunes as the memory of the Napoleonic Wars receded, so the Great Inflation is already expanding cloud capital’s reach into the energy sector.</p>
<p id="tec0000268">The fossil fuel industry is an unholy alliance of feudal-style contracts and terrestrial capital: it relies on licences to drill on particular patches of land or ocean bed, for which governments and private landlords receive old-fashioned ground rent. It also relies on old-fashioned capital goods, including oil rigs, tankers and pipelines, to feed fossil fuels into large, highly concentrated, vertically integrated power stations which, both <span aria-label="140" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg140" role="doc-pagebreak"/>aesthetically and economically, are not so dissimilar from a ‘dark satanic mill’ of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p id="tec0000269">Renewables, in contrast, are best deployed in a decentralised fashion, with solar panels, wind turbines, heat pumps, geothermal units and wave-powered devices all horizontally integrated as part of a network. With little need for licences that incur ground rent, their productivity depends instead on digital infrastructure running on sophisticated software utilising artificial intelligence. In short, green energy is cloud-capital-intensive, much like the electric car industry.</p>
<p id="tec0000270">The need to switch from fossil fuels to green energy could not be more urgent. The rise in energy costs that is an integral part of the Great Inflation would seem to have taken us away from that goal, offering a windfall to the fossil fuel industry. But this will not last long. Advances in green energy are pushing down fast the costs of green electricity generation. Even though the life cycle of fossil fuels has been extended, ruinously for the planet, cloud-based green energy is growing – and, with it, so is the relative power of cloudalists.</p>
<p id="tec0000271">Technofeudalism has an inbuilt tendency to dampen price inflation, as it is in its nature to squeeze wages, prices and profits. But how exactly the Great Inflation will unfold in the short term is impossible to predict accurately because, as we have seen already, inflation is always a symptom of a flare-up of the ongoing class war; its trajectory will be determined primarily by politics and power. And what is certain is that by enhancing the scope of cloud capital, the Great Inflation will ultimately be bad for labour’s political power, as it turns more of us into cloud proles.</p>
<p id="tec0000272">Still, a large question mark hangs over the future of technofeudalism: now that the Great Inflation has forced central banks to stop their money-printing, causing the cloudalists’ <span aria-label="141" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg141" role="doc-pagebreak"/>share prices to tank and tens of thousands of Big Tech employees to lose their jobs; and now that oil companies and supermarkets are enjoying some fabulous profits, won’t the technofeudal bubble burst? Has it not burst already?</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000273"><em>Back to your question: is capitalism not back on track?</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000274">Your original question was whether the internet would make capitalism invincible or prove its undoing – and by now you know my answer. But given the economic tumult in the post-pandemic years, it would be reasonable to wonder whether the trends and principles I have identified still hold. Hasn’t the Great Inflation revived capitalism?</p>
<p id="tec0000275">Mainstream economic commentators found the Great Inflation rather unmysterious, and certainly not the sign of some underlying historic transformation – technofeudalist or otherwise. To them, inflation was the natural consequence of central bankers printing too much money, and of governments overspending it during the pandemic. As red-faced central bankers were forced to raise interest rates throughout 2022 in order to choke off demand and put a lid on rising prices, normally solemn commentators were hardly able to contain their pleasure at the apparent admission of their mistake.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter005_en_8" id="chapter005_en8" role="doc-noteref">8</a> The Great Inflation of 2022 was to them what the Stuart Restoration of 1660 had been to British royalists: a return to agreeably familiar patterns of authority.</p>
<p id="tec0000276">Not only that, with money becoming more expensive to borrow and to hold, the mad years when money’s price languished around zero had ended. Sanity had been restored. There was a price to pay, of course; the familiar hangover after the party ended. With interest rates rising, financiers <span aria-label="142" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg142" role="doc-pagebreak"/>relying on borrowed money to play the stock exchanges were forced to exit the market and, unsurprisingly, share prices declined even faster than interest rates had risen. And since the higher the rise the harder the fall, it was the cloudalist conglomerates – whose stock exchange value had taken off during the pandemic – that fell the most under the Great Inflation. During 2022, the total share value of US Big Tech cloudalist companies shrank by a remarkable $4 trillion – though more remarkable still, perhaps, was the fact that their stock exchange valuation remained, on average, above its pre-pandemic level. Meanwhile, lockdown winners like Peleton, Zoom and Carvana all plummeted. So did ‘meme stocks’ like AMC and GameStop, so-called SPACs and NFTs – not to mention Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and other crypto false promises. The commentariat was almost relieved: technofeudalism, even if it had been taking hold for a brief period, was just another burst bubble.</p>
<p id="tec0000277">From their point of view, our focus for concern as we navigate persistent inflation should be the connection between energy and food prices and the war in Ukraine, US sanctions on various countries, relocalisation of production due to the prospects of a New Cold War between America and China, ageing populations, stricter immigration controls. In other words, it’s back to business as usual. And many left-wingers have found similar solace in the Great Inflation. They may abhor the hardships that inflation inflicts on the poor but welcome the feeling that the world makes sense to them again. With the price of money rising well above zero once more, and the market value of companies like Meta, Tesla and Amazon crashing down to Earth, the old capitalist order they know well how to despise is back. I sense that you too, Dad, might be harbouring similar thoughts.</p>
<p id="tec0000278"><span aria-label="143" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg143" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Well, I’m sorry to say, there will be no return to the good old bad old days.</p>
<p id="tec0000279">First, those torrents of central bank money have already built cloud capital up to critical mass. It is here to stay – and to dominate – because its immense structural power, to extract vast cloud rents from every society on Earth, remains completely undiminished. This would not be the first time a bubble has built up capital that endures after the bubble’s bursting. America owes its railways to precisely this pattern: that bubble burst in the nineteenth century but not before tracks were laid down that are still in place, from Boston and New York to Los Angeles and San Diego. More recently, when the dot.com bubble burst in 2001, bankrupting early internet-based companies whose stock market valuations had reached ridiculous levels, it left behind the network of fibre optic cables and servers which provided the infrastructure underpinning Internet Two and Big Tech.</p>
<p id="tec0000280">Second, the central bank money has not actually run dry. It is still flowing, albeit at a slower pace which nonetheless suffices to keep technofeudalism buoyant. Central banks can’t afford to stem their flow completely, even if this is what they must do to defeat the Great Inflation. Recent bank failures in California and Switzerland reminded America’s and Europe’s central banks that, if they dare withdraw the trillions they have pumped into the North Atlantic economies, a vortex of volatility is ready to hit the $24 trillion market for the United States’ public debt – the very bedrock of international banking and finance.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter005_en_9" id="chapter005_en9" role="doc-noteref">9</a> The European Central Bank knows that it risks pushing every German bank plus the state of Italy into a deep bankruptcy, and in so doing blowing up the euro. The Bank of Japan, the first central bank to practise energetic money-printing back in the 1990s, refuses even <span aria-label="144" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg144" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to imagine ending the practice. As for the Bank of England, on 28 September 2022, after formally announcing the end of its pound-printing, it had to beat an ignominious retreat, printing an extra £65 billion to pacify the market for the UK’s public debt.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter005_en_10" id="chapter005_en10" role="doc-noteref">10</a> In short, central bank money is here to stay and will continue to play the systemic role once held by capitalist profits.</p>
<p id="tec0000281">Third, cloud capital is now so well entrenched that it is bolstered and augmented not just by central bank money and its own capacity to amass cloud rent but from every new development as it arises: from the need for more renewables and self-driving cars to the demands for cheap online degree programmes for youngsters who can’t afford more student debt, cloud capital expands its domain exponentially. Paradoxically, as we have seen in the case of electric cars and green energy, this even includes the Great Inflation itself, which is doing much of the heavy lifting in the great rebalancing of power away from terrestrial capital and towards cloud capital – in a word, from capitalism to technofeudalism.</p>
<p id="tec0000282">My aim in this chapter has been to convince you that the word technofeudalism can, in the words of Simone Weil, ‘help us to grasp some concrete reality or concrete objective, or method of activity’ in a way that no variant on capitalism can. Technofeudalism, I claimed, is qualitatively distinct from capitalism and, thus, as a word, it illuminates crucial aspects of the real world in ways that rentier capitalism or platform capitalism or hyper-capitalism cannot. It is time now to unleash its explanatory power further, for I believe it helps us understand not only our socio-economic condition but also the titanic power struggle that may well define this century: the New Cold War between the United States and China.</p>
