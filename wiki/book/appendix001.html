<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000469">Under feudalism, the power of the ruling class grew out of owning land that the majority could not own, but were bonded to. Under capitalism, power stemmed from owning capital that the majority did not own, but had to work with to make a living. Under technofeudalism, a new ruling class draws power from owning cloud capital whose tentacles entangle everyone. In this Appendix, after summarising how capitalism generated value, surplus and power, I’ll sketch out the generation and distribution of surplus and power in our technofeudal societies.</p>

<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000471">DISCLAIMER: My theoretical take below is not objective science. It could not be because no economist can claim to be objective or scientific (especially those who claim to be). Unlike Physics Nobel Laureates, who always respect (even if they do not like) each other, two winners of the equivalent economics honour (the Bank of Sweden’s Prize for Economics in the Memory of Alfred Nobel) often consider each other to be charlatans. That’s because economics is more like a philosophy (or religion) embellished with complex equations and voluminous statistics offering those who speak its language huge power over the rest who do not. Economics is best seen as a contested terrain on which armies of politically motivated ideas (some favouring the ruling class, others the exploited classes) clash mercilessly to win over our hearts and minds. For the record, the analysis <span aria-label="216" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg216" role="doc-pagebreak"/>below is in the tradition of the classical economists, e.g. Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Karl Marx – with splashes of John Maynard Keynes, John Kenneth Galbraith and Hyman Minsky.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#appendix001_en_1" id="appendix001_en1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></p>

<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000472"><em>Capitalism</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000473">Key to understanding how capitalism produces wealth and distributes it is by virtue of value, labour and capital, each possessing a dual nature. The duality in their natures was the source of the great surpluses from which capitalist profits sprang. These profits, along with debt, funded the formation of capital whose accumulation shaped the modern world.</p>

<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000475">Commodities are goods or services produced exclusively to be sold, rather than to be experienced or gifted by their producers. Under capitalism (but also under all pre-capitalist systems), buying and selling was confined to markets.</p>

<p id="tec0000478"><em>Note</em>: They can be less or more competitive, oligopolistic (few sellers, many buyers) or oligopsonistic (many sellers, few buyers); tending at its limit to monopoly (a single seller and many buyers) or monopsony. Markets wither when the number of buyers and the number of sellers both shrink, tending to one on each side (in which case we have a case of one-on-one bargaining, or bilateral monopoly/psony).</p>
<p id="tec0000479"><em>Note</em>: Under technofeudalism, trading is centralised and takes place not in markets but in cloud fiefs (e.g. Big Tech platforms) <span aria-label="217" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg217" role="doc-pagebreak"/>created and run by the algorithms of cloud capital which match buyers and sellers – see 11.2.3 below.</p>

<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000484">Experiential Value flows out of any experience humans value; from drinking a glass of cold water when thirsty, to enjoying a beautiful sunset, to solving an equation or humming a song, to shopping, to feeling appreciated. Experiential value is, thus, an intangible, unquantifiable, subjective, quicksilver value.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#appendix001_en_2" id="appendix001_en2" role="doc-noteref">2</a> It always existed, and always will as long as humans are sentient, independently of how we organise production.</p>
<p id="tec0000485">Exchange Value is the quantifiable value of a commodity under capitalism. More precisely, the exchange value of a unit of some commodity is measured by how many units of other commodities it can be exchanged with. It is reflected in (but is not reducible to – see note below) the price of a good or service which has been produced for sale, not to be experienced or gifted by those who produced it (i.e. a commodity is aimed at end buyers prepared to pay for the experiential value they will derive from it).</p>
<p id="tec0000486"><em>Note:</em> The greater the competition between several sellers, the closer the price of a commodity reflects its exchange value which, in turn, is determined by (or reflects) the total experiential labour (see <a href="#tec0000489">1.2.1</a> below) expended in its production by every human involved, directly or indirectly, in producing it.</p>

<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000491">Experiential Labour is the elusive, unquantifiable, quicksilver and occasionally magical aspect of human work that, during the <span aria-label="218" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg218" role="doc-pagebreak"/>production process, breathes into a thing or a service the capacity to impart experiential value (see <a href="#tec0000482">1.1.1</a>) to whomever gets to experience or consume the final product or service.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#appendix001_en_3" id="appendix001_en3" role="doc-noteref">3</a> Focusing on commodities (that have been produced for sale), experiential labour is the human input that infuses them with exchange value during the process of production (see <a href="#tec0000483">1.1.2</a>).</p>
<p id="tec0000492">Commodity Labour is the bundle of labour time and skills a worker leases to an employer. The exchange value of commodity labour equals the sum of the experiential labour that other workers have put into the commodities that a waged worker’s wage can buy. In the same way that price is the (seldom perfect) reflection of a commodity’s exchange value, the wage is the (seldom perfect) reflection of commodity labour’s exchange value.</p>

<li class="nl3" id="tec0000496"><span class="sans">1.3.2. A social relation that affords its owners extractive power over non-owners</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000497">A produced means of commodity production takes the familiar form of physical capital, e.g. machines, factory or office buildings, tractors, etc. Because they are commodities (or, as they often called, capital goods) produced exclusively to assist in the production of other commodities, they can be thought of as physical artefacts purchased as labour productivity enhancers. More abstractly, they can also be thought of as previously expended, or ‘dead’, experiential labour now crystallised in physical means of production.</p>
<p id="tec0000498">A social relation that affords capital’s owners extractive power over non-owners – besides its physical presence and function, capital provides its owners with the social power necessary to extract surplus value (see <a href="#tec0000501">1.4</a> below) from workers who do not own capital.</p>
<p id="tec0000499"><em>Note:</em> There is nothing mystical or puzzling about the physical <span aria-label="219" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg219" role="doc-pagebreak"/>nature and function of fishing rods, tractors or industrial robots (i.e. of capital goods). However, capital’s nature as a provider of extractive power is less obvious. The extractive power it affords derives from the social relations between people with property rights over (and, therefore, autonomous access to) means of production (capitalists, landlords) and the rest. The asymmetry in capital ownership leaves those who do not own capital no alternative but to sell to capitalists their commodity labour (see <a href="#tec0000490">1.2.2</a> above), for a wage, and, in the process, to generate surplus value (see <a href="#tec0000501">1.4</a> below) for the capitalists. To illustrate, recall how (<a href="chapter003.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <a href="chapter003.xhtml#pg60">pp. 60–61</a>) Mr Peel lost his extractive power over the English workers he had transported to Western Australia once they gained autonomous access to means of production (i.e. to plentiful land in the surrounding areas) independently of Mr Peel. Capital’s second nature, its <em>extractive power</em>, originates from such asymmetrical access to produced means of commodity production.</p>

</ol>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000506">In the same way that prices reflect (but are not reducible to) the value of commodities, wages reflect (but are not reducible to) the exchange value of commodity labour (<a href="#tec0000490">1.2.2</a> above).</p>
<p id="tec0000507"><em><span aria-label="220" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg220" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Note:</em> The greater the competition between several employers, the closer the wage reflects the exchange value of the worker’s commodity labour. Thus, in labour markets dominated by one or few employers, the wage falls short of the exchange value of the worker’s commodity labour – which translates into a type of monopsony rent (see <a href="#tec0000517">2.3.3</a> below) retained by the employer.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#appendix001_en_5" id="appendix001_en5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></p>

</ol>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000510">Capitalists must borrow (occasionally from themselves, i.e. from their accumulated profits) to purchase labour, land and capital goods before production begins. To break even, their revenues must cover – in addition to all their other costs – the interest financiers charge them (or which they would have earned from saving that money had they not entered into production).</p>
<ol class="list_none">
<li class="nl2a" id="tec0000512"><span class="sans">2.3 Rents</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000513">Rent is any price paid by a buyer above the price which most closely reflects the exchange value of the commodity (1.1.2). An equivalent definition of rent is as monies paid for a commodity in excess of the minimum price necessary for that commodity to have been produced. Four types of rent are prevalent under capitalism:</p>
<ol class="list_none1a">
<li class="nl3" id="tec0000515"><span class="sans">2.3.1 Financial Rent</span></li>
<li class="nl3" id="tec0000516"><span class="sans">2.3.2 Ground Rent</span></li>

<li class="nl3" id="tec0000518"><span class="sans">2.3.4 Brand Rent</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000519">Financial Rent refers to payments to financiers (e.g., bankers) in excess of the minimum interest necessary to motivate them to provide the loan. Financial rent also includes returns from speculating in share, real estate and derivative markets, in private equity, etc.</p>
<p id="tec0000520">Ground Rent predates capitalism and comes close to (though <span aria-label="221" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg221" role="doc-pagebreak"/>it does not coincide with) the everyday use of the word ‘rent’: any payment for leasing land over and above the minimum (which may tend to zero) that would be necessary to motivate its owner to lease it.</p>
<p id="tec0000521">Monopoly Rent obtains due to low or non-existent competition (oligopoly or monopoly) which allows a seller to extract from consumers payment in excess of the commodity’s exchange value. In common parlance, the monetary equivalent of monopoly rent is known as a ‘mark-up’ (or ‘price-cost margin’) that the seller can charge the customer over and above a commodity’s exchange value.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#appendix001_en_6" id="appendix001_en6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></p>
<p id="tec0000522">Brand Rent is a form of monopoly rent which the seller can extract from consumers who are motivated to pay for a branded item or service more than its exchange value, e.g. in pursuit of status signalling or ownership of positional goods (i.e. goods desired not so much for themselves but, rather, for the fact that others cannot own them, e.g. a limited-run print or an antique vase).</p>
<ol class="list_none">
<li class="nl2a" id="tec0000524"><span class="sans">2.4 Profit</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000525">Profit is the portion of the revenue capitalists retain after they have paid wages to workers, ground rent to landlords, interest and financial rent to financiers plus fees to professionals (e.g. marketers, advertisers), helping them build up brand rents.</p>
<h4 class="list_head" id="tec0000526"><span class="sans">3.</span> <span class="sans">MONEY</span> <span class="sans">and</span> <span class="sans">CIRCULATION</span></h4>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000527">The exchange values that capitalism produces (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>) are transformed into prices, wages, interest and profits within various markets where commodities are exchanged for money.</p>
<p id="tec0000528">For production to begin, private monies (comprising previous profit and new bank loans) are spent by firms on inputs such as commodity labour (see <a href="#tec0000490">1.2.2</a>), physical capital (see <a href="#tec0000496">1.3.2</a>), buildings and land, and other commodities needed as raw materials.</p>

</figure>
<p id="tec0000529"><span aria-label="223" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg223" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Within the firms, due to the twin natures of labour and capital, surplus value is generated which the firm’s owners retain (i.e. capital’s nature as an extractive power enables the firm to extract – unpaid for – experiential labour that infuses its output with exchange value greater than that of its inputs).</p>
<p id="tec0000530">Once commodity output is sold, the firms (courtesy of the surplus value generated during the production process) end up with more money than they started this cycle with. These monies then turn into incomes (wages, taxes and the different types of rents – see <a href="#tec0000509">2.2</a>). The augmented private incomes (net of taxes and all spending on repaying financiers or landowners), plus public expenditures and new consumer debt, return to markets in the form of consumer and government (private and public) consumption. Lastly, unspent capitalist profit, plus new corporate debt, funds the new cycle of the production process. And so on.</p>
<p id="tec0000531">The two linchpins holding capitalism’s circulation process together (see <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>) are:</p>

<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000538">Capital goods – like all commodities – are produced within capitalist firms utilising waged labour and previously produced capital <span aria-label="225" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg225" role="doc-pagebreak"/>goods. Capital accumulation thus occurs at the micro level (i.e. the level of the firm, enterprise, corporation or conglomerate – see <a href="#tec0000540">4.1</a> below). However, the rate at which capital accumulates within firms depends on macro forces that are irreducible to the micro level (see <a href="#tec0000543">4.2</a> below).</p>

</ol>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000554">During the good times, the financiers’ rents rise geometrically – if not exponentially. Caught up in a gold-fever-like mentality, they lend burgeoning sums to capitalists – which they borrow from the future. At some point the present cannot produce enough value to repay the future, the bubble bursts, and the psychological pendulum swings the opposite way, causing financiers to go on a credit strike. The result is a domino effect of collapsing corporate, FIRE (finance, insurance and real estate) and, often, public debt.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#appendix001_en_12" id="appendix001_en12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></p>
<p id="tec0000555"><em>Note:</em> Recessions are often self-correcting, e.g. wages and input prices fall so much during a slump that surviving firms (which now face less competition, courtesy of so many of their competitors having shut down) see their profit rate rise again.

<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000572"><em>Note</em>: Capitalist Power (7.4) extended beyond the confines of the capitalist firm and infected the pre-existing three types of extractive power.

<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000574">The technostructure (see <a href="chapter002.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>) developed two new economic sectors whose purpose was to modify the behaviour of workers and of consumers respectively. These highly professionalised <em>behavioural modification sectors</em> significantly enhanced capital’s power (its second nature more precisely).</p>
<ol class="list_none">
<li class="nl2" id="tec0000576"><span class="sans">8.1 Labour Command Service Sector – Located in and around the workplace, these professionals applied well-researched, scientific management procedures to speed up the labour process and to squeeze more experiential labour out of a given quantity of commodity labour. Their techniques included Taylorist organisation of the factory floor, sophisticated surveillance, Fordist production lines, Japanese management practices (co-opting workers to the company’s ideology), etc.</span></li>
<li class="nl2" id="tec0000577"><span class="sans">8.2 Consumer Command Service Sector – Brimming with advertisers, marketers, copywriters and creative types (epitomised in <a href="chapter003.xhtml">Chapter 3</a></span> <span aria-label="229" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg229" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="sans">by the fictional Don Draper), this sector helped maximise brand rents</span> <span class="sans">by manufacturing consumer desires for the large firms’ branded products – thus underpinning their power over both consumers and smaller competitors lacking access to this sector.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000578">The development of these two sectors was mirrored into two brand-new markets.</p>
<ul>
<li id="tec0000579">Market for Professionalised Influencers – A new type of manager began to dominate the conglomerates, pushing aside the engineers who used to rise through the company’s ranks. A whole market for their services, and for training them (e.g. the cult of the MBA), extended from traditional industrial sectors to Wall Street and even to public administration.</li>
<li id="tec0000580">Market for People’s Attention – The Consumer Command Service Sector was dedicated to capturing the attention of television and radio audiences before selling it on to advertisers (see <a href="chapter002.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> – Attention markets and the Soviets’ revenge).</li>
</ul>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000581">Having access to these two command service sectors and markets, the technostructure secured for itself an inordinate double privilege: an asymmetric (soft) power to manipulate, and to modify, the behaviour of both workers and consumers.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000582"><em>Technofeudalism</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000583">Just as capitalism pushed aside feudalism by replacing land with capital as the dominant factor of production, so too did technofeudalism ride in to displace capitalism on the coat-tails of cloud capital – a mutation of (standard, terrestrial) capital.</p>

<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000585">Cloud capital is, physically, defined as the agglomeration of networked machinery, software, AI-driven algorithms and communications’ hardware criss-crossing the whole planet and performing a wide variety of tasks, new and old, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li id="tec0000586">Inciting billons of non-waged people (cloud serfs) to work for free (and often unconsciously) at replenishing cloud capital’s own stock (e.g. to upload photos and videos on Instagram or TikTok, or submit film, restaurant and book reviews)</li>
<li id="tec0000587">Helping us switch off the lights while recommending to us books, films and holidays, etc., so impressively in tune with our interests that we become predisposed to other goods sold on cloud fiefs or platforms (e.g. <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>), which are running on exactly the same digital network that helps us switch off the lights while recommending to us books, films and holidays, etc.</li>
<li id="tec0000588">Utilising AI and Big Data to command workers’ labour (cloud proles) on the factory floor while driving the energy networks, the robots, the trucks, the automated production lines and the 3D printers that bypass conventional manufacturing</li>
</ul>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000589">By automating the technostructure’s two behaviour modification sectors (see <a href="#tec0000576">8.1</a> and <a href="#tec0000577">8.2</a>), cloud capital has removed them from the economy’s human-driven service economy and incorporated them fully into its machine network. The jobs performed, under the technostructure, by shop-floor managers, advertisers, marketers, etc. under Technofeudalism are now assigned to AI-driven algorithms incorporated fully into cloud capital.</p>
<p id="tec0000590"><span aria-label="231" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg231" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In terms of the analysis under 1.3, which pertained to capital’s two natures (see <a href="#tec0000495">1.3.1</a> and <a href="#tec0000496">1.3.2</a>), cloud capital distinguishes itself from earlier forms of capital by adding a third nature to capital’s original twin nature:</p>

</ol>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000593">Cloud capital’s third nature straddles three types of algorithmic behaviour modification. One strand commands consumers to reproduce cloud capital (i.e. turns them into cloud serfs). A second strand commands waged labour to work harder (i.e. turns proletarians and members of the precariat into cloud proles). And a third strand replaces markets with cloud fiefs. In a sense, cloud capital’s third nature grants its owners (the cloudalists) a great brand-new power to extract surplus value produced in the traditional capitalist sector – as <a href="#fig3">Figure 3 on p. 234</a> illustrates.</p>
<p id="tec0000594">More analytically, cloud capital’s third nature furnishes it with the three functions or forms.</p>

<li class="nl3a1" id="tec0000598"><span class="sans">9.1.2 Cloud Serfs: Persons unattached to any corporation (i.e. non-workers) choose to labour long and often hard, for free, to reproduce cloud capital’s stock, e.g. with posts, videos, photos, reviews and lots of clicking that makes digital platforms more attractive to others.</span></li>

Cloud capital’s platforms make it easy for work to move out of the labour market into an economy that is disguised with the paraphernalia of gaming, chance and lotteries when, in reality, it is all about mechanical, repetitive, Fordist work. Digital spaces that appear modern, snazzy, friendly and neutral are in fact well-designed projects of cutting much of paid labour out of the labour market, making the wage optional and even altogether replacing it with a sequence of wagers.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#appendix001_en_13" id="appendix001_en13" role="doc-noteref">13</a></p>

</ol>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000602">As explained in <a href="chapter003.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> (see pp. <a href="chapter003.xhtml#pg85">85–88</a>, ‘Wither markets, hello cloud fiefs’), ecommerce platforms like <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> or <a href="http://alibaba.com">alibaba.com</a> are not markets (defined in <a href="#tec0000477">1.0</a> and <a href="#tec0000518">3.4</a> above). The reason they cannot be thought of as markets is that the cloudalists’ algorithms succeed in isolating every buyer from every other buyer, and every seller from every other seller. As a result, the cloudalist’s algorithm concentrates in itself the power to match buyers and sellers – which is the exact opposite of what a market is meant to be: decentralised. Such power vested in the cloudalist’s algorithm grants its owner the capacity to charge sellers (i.e. conventional capitalists) large amounts of rent (cloud rent) for access to customers.</p>
<ol class="list_none" id="tec0000603">
<li class="nl3a" id="tec0000604"><span class="sans">9.2.1</span> <span class="sans">Cloud Fiefs are digital trading platforms on which buyers and sellers are matched by the algorithms of cloud capital. While they look like markets, their perfect centralisation (achieved by the algorithm’s power to match and to determine the full information set of each buyer and each seller) renders them a form of cloud fief belonging to whoever owns the algorithm or cloud capital which (a) built the platform and (b) attracts cloud serfs</span> <span aria-label="233" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg233" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="sans">to play the role of buyers (as well as contributors to its cloud capital) and vassal capitalists in the role of sellers.</span></li>

</ol>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000607">In summary, cloud capital’s greatest accomplishment was increasingly to induct into its AI-algorithmic-digital network not only the processes of modifying workers’ and consumers’ behaviour in the interests of cloudalists but, also, the market itself – turning whole segments of the capitalist class into its vassals.</p>

<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000609"><a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> illustrated the distribution of exchange value under capitalism. Under technofeudalism, the capitalist sector continues (as it did under capitalism) to produce all of the economy’s exchange value. However, the capitalist sector is now embedded into, and is subjugated within, the broader realm of cloud fiefs built on cloud capital. As cloud capital accumulates, due to the unpaid labour of cloud serfs and the cloud rents of the vassal capitalists, more and more of the surplus value generated in the capitalist sector is syphoned off in the form of more cloud rent to the cloudalists. <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> illustrates this.</p>

The result was a new type of capital (cloud capital) which became a produced means of, on the one hand, commanding labour and, on the other, of extracting cloud rent from capitalists for access to consumers (9.1 and 9.2).</span></li>
<li class="nl3a2" id="tec0000615"><span class="sans">11.2 Profit and Markets Dethroned – Technofeudalism replaced capitalism’s twin pillars – Profit (2.4 and 3.3) and Markets (1.0 and 3.4) – with its own twin pillars – Cloud Rent (9.2.3) and Cloud Fiefs (9.2.1).</span></li>
<li class="nl3a2" id="tec0000616"><span class="sans">11.3 Technofeudal Class System – Under technofeudalism, the cloudalists (a segment of the capitalist class who managed to accumulate considerable cloud capital) became our new ruling class, confining the rest of the capitalists (lacking sufficient access to cloud capital) to vassal class status (9.2.2). Meanwhile, waged workers are turning into increasingly precarious cloud proles (9.1.1) and almost everyone acts as a cloud serf (9.1.2) helping cloud capital accumulate and construct the cloud fiefs (9.2.1) that are replacing markets.</span></li>
<li class="nl3a2" id="tec0000617"><span class="sans">11.4 Capital Accumulation – Unlike standard, or terrestrial, capital which accumulated strictly within capitalist firms (4.1), albeit at rates dictated at the macroeconomic level (4.2), cloud capital accumulates at another two levels most forcefully: on the back of cloud-serf labour (9.1.2) provided by almost all of us. And, with massive funding directly from the West’s main central banks – see <a href="chapter004.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>.</span></li>
<li class="nl3a2" id="tec0000618"><span class="sans">11.5 A Fifth Type of Extractive Power – Cloud capital adds a new extractive power to the four pre-existing ones – brute (7.1), political (7.2),</span> <span class="sans">soft (7.3) and capitalist (7.4) – a cloudalist power vested in the owners</span> <span class="sans">of cloud capital with which to modify the behaviour of those who do not own or control cloud capital in a manner that permits massive</span> <span aria-label="236" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg236" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="sans">surplus value produced in the capitalist sector to be directed to the cloudalists as cloud rent.</span></li>

</ol>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000620"><em>Note</em>: Technofeudalism is synonymous with the universalisation of exploitation (see <a href="#tec0000611">10.1</a>) and with the shrinking of the value base (in proportion to the rise of cloud rent’s share of all incomes – see <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). This dynamic accentuates the system’s propensity to deeper and more frequent crises. As a result, the central banks that funded the initial accumulation of cloud capital (see <a href="chapter004.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>) will be forced perpetually to print more and more monies to replace the role that profits and wages used to play under capitalism. But this only helps cloud capital accumulate further (since cloudalists will always have a greater capacity than every other class to appropriate the printed central bank money). In short, technofeudalism is condemned to exhibit a dynamic doom-loop more volatile and explosive than even that of capitalism.</p>
