<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000284">On 15 May 2019, President Donald Trump issued a decree which, in effect, banned Google from allowing use of its Android operating system on smartphones made by Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications conglomerate. Trump was effectively evicting Huawei from Google’s global cloud fief. Washington also told European governments to suspend their plan to involve Huawei in the roll-out of 5G mobile networks across Europe. It was much more than Trumpist folly. When Joe Biden moved into the White House, the New Cold War with China that Trump had kick-started moved up a gear – especially in October 2022 when, according to the <em>New York Times</em>, ‘The White House issued sweeping restrictions on selling semiconductors and chip-making equipment to China, an attempt to curb the country’s access to critical technologies.’ In essence, Biden told Beijing: the United States will crush your dreams of building a technologically advanced economy.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_1" id="chapter006_en1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></p>
<p id="tec0000285">What happened there? To explain their decisions, both Trump and Biden cited national security concerns and played up long-standing tensions with China over Taiwan and the South China Sea. But neither China’s communist regime nor its stance on Taiwan were new, urgent or unexpected. Moreover, where were these ‘concerns’ when Apple, and many other American conglomerates, were setting up camp across communist China’s coastline from the mid-2000s onwards? Or when Washington was moving heaven and earth to let <span aria-label="146" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg146" role="doc-pagebreak"/>China into the World Trade Organization in the 1990s? Or after 2008, when Beijing boosted investment from around 30 per cent of national income to more than 50 per cent, creating global demand for Europe’s and America’s products and thus helping to save US-dominated financialised capitalism from itself? Why did these ‘concerns’ suddenly, and well before the war in Ukraine, yield a New Cold War?</p>
<p id="tec0000286">To solve the puzzle, we must briefly return to the parable of the Minotaur.</p>
<p id="tec0000287">Recall how until the Nixon Shock of 1971, any non-American with large quantities of dollars could exchange them at will for gold owned by the US government at a fixed price of $35 per ounce. For as long as America sold more stuff to Europe and Asia than it imported from them, as it did between the war’s end and 1965, this trade surplus meant that every time America sold a jet or refrigerator in France or Japan, the foreign-held dollars that paid for them would be repatriated and America’s gold reserves would remain untouched. However, by the mid-sixties the United States had turned into a deficit country, buying goods of greater dollar value from foreigners than it sold to them. This led to a torrent of dollars leaving America for Europe and Asia and not coming back. And the larger the US trade deficit, the more claims foreigners had over America’s gold. In time, they grew anxious that the US government did not have enough gold to match their dollars and there was a run on America’s gold. To prevent losing it all, on 15 August 1971, Nixon told the world that they would no longer exchange foreign-held dollars for gold at that fixed price. In other words: no more gold for you from our vaults. Our dollars are now your problem.</p>
<p id="tec0000288">Non-American central banks suddenly had no alternative <span aria-label="147" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg147" role="doc-pagebreak"/>than to use dollars instead of gold as reserves to back the value of their currency. The dollar began to resemble an … IOU. After the so-called Nixon Shock, the global financial system was, effectively, backed by IOUs issued by a hegemon who could decide what the foreign IOU-holders could do with their IOUs – and what they were not allowed to do with them. America was now a deficit country but was nothing like any other deficit country. ‘Normal’ deficit countries, such as France, Greece or India, had to borrow dollars to shore up their currency and to raise interest rates domestically to stop money outflows. America did not need to do any of that. It had, in other words, found the magic formula every empire had hitherto only dreamed of: how to persuade wealthy foreigners, and foreign central banks, voluntarily to finance simultaneously its government and its imports!</p>
<p id="tec0000289">This is how the Minotaur arose. Rather than sell the world goods, America offered it an alternative use for their dollars: invest them in Wall Street. They had created a mechanism that could recycle Asian and European surpluses (mainly Chinese and German) into productive investments for the USA. With these tributes to the Minotaur, peace and prosperity for all continued – until of course it all collapsed in 2008.</p>
<p id="tec0000290">So how does this relate to the New Cold War between America and China? From 1971 onwards, any non-American capitalist with massive dollar wealth faced the same problem: what to do with dollars in a country where they could not spend dollars? The only option was to take them back to America to invest them there. However, foreign capitalists soon discovered that the US government was not like other governments. In Britain, Greece or Spain, rich foreigners could buy whatever they pleased. In no uncertain terms, <span aria-label="148" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg148" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Washington made it clear to German, Japanese, and (later) Chinese capitalists: in our country, the United States of America, you can buy real estate. You can buy our government debt. You can buy small, insignificant companies, bankrupted factories in our rust belts and, of course, Wall Street’s labyrinthine derivatives. But keep your grubby hands off our Boeing, our General Electric, our Big Tech, our Big Pharma and, of course, our banks.</p>
<p id="tec0000291">Which brings us back to Trump’s ban on Huawei and Biden’s declaration of economic war on Chinese tech companies. The underlying logic of these prohibitions was a straightforward extension of the same thinking, adapted to the circumstances of a post-2008 technofeudal world: with cloud capital dominating terrestrial capital, the maintenance of US hegemony requires more than preventing foreign capitalists from buying up US capitalist conglomerates, like Boeing and General Electric. In a world where cloud capital is borderless, global, capable of siphoning cloud rents from anywhere, the maintenance of US hegemony demands a direct confrontation with the only cloudalist class to have emerged as a threat to their own: China’s.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000292"><em>Technofeudalism with Chinese characteristics</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000293">True hegemons prevail not by force but by offering hard-to-resist Faustian bargains. One such was the Dark Deal, as a Chinese official once described it to me, that underlay US–China economic relations prior to the New Cold War. At its heart was an implicit offer by America’s ruling class to China’s ruling class – an offer directly equivalent to that of the Minotaur: we shall keep demand for your products high <span aria-label="149" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg149" role="doc-pagebreak"/>using our trade deficit. We shall also shift our industrial production to your factories. In return, you will voluntarily invest your profits in our finance, insurance and real estate sectors – known affectionately as FIRE.</p>
<p id="tec0000294">It was a tried and tested recipe. Ever since the Nixon Shock turned the dollar into a glorified IOU, Americans had been buying more or less everything that Japan’s factories could produce, paying in dollars that Japanese capitalists had no alternative but to invest in American FIRE. Following Nixon’s famous visit to Beijing in 1972, signalling America’s strategy to push a wedge between China and the USSR by establishing relations with the People’s Republic, following decades of non-communication and even war, America’s smart money envisioned China as a Japan-writ-large – a vision that Deng Xiaoping eventually indulged by opening up China to the West.</p>
<p id="tec0000295">Japanese electronics, Chinese clothes and Korean television sets flooded Walmart while the profits netted by Japan’s, China’s and Korea’s capitalists bought them US Treasuries, golf courses, skyscrapers and Wall Street’s derivatives. From the 1970s onwards, globalised capitalism was founded on this fascinating recycling of, mainly, Asian manufacturing profits into American rents, which in turn sustained the American imports that provided Asian factories with sufficient demand.</p>
<p id="tec0000296">Why call it a Dark Deal? Because in the small print of this pact between America’s and East Asia’s ruling classes was written misery for workers on both sides of the Pacific. American workers faced the exploitation and immiseration that resulted from underinvestment and its industrial heartlands being hollowed out by manufacturing in Asia and the underdeveloped Global South. Meanwhile, in China’s <span aria-label="150" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg150" role="doc-pagebreak"/>fast-industrialising coastal cities, workers suffered the frenzied exploitation associated with overinvestment – it was as if parts of the Global North, fattened by overinvestment, were migrating into Chinese urban centres where local workers struggled to survive on Global South wages and social benefits. Different miseries, same global recycling process.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_2" id="chapter006_en2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></p>
<p id="tec0000297">That was the East-meets-West aspect of globalisation. Then there was, of course, the Global South – deficit countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America with weak economies constantly agonising over a shortage of dollars which they had to borrow from Wall Street to import medicines, energy and the raw materials necessary to produce their own exports, which they needed to earn the requisite dollars to repay Wall Street. Inevitably, every now and then, they ran out. At that point, the West would send in the bailiffs – the International Monetary Fund – which would lend the missing dollars on condition that the debtor government handed over the country’s water, land, ports, airports, electricity and telephone networks, even its schools and hospitals, to the local and international oligarchs who would, once in control of these companies and assets, have no alternative but to channel their earnings into Wall Street. That was the neocolonial aspect of the same global recycling mechanism which secured US hegemony or, to use my favoured analogy, the Minotaur’s reign.</p>
<p id="tec0000298">Then came the crash of 2008. This had two main effects that, together, underpin today’s New Cold War: it strengthened China’s position in the global surplus recycling mechanism, and it turbocharged the build-up of cloud capital both in the United States and in China. To see how this caused the world to divide into two new blocks or, to be more precise, two super cloud fiefs, it helps to delve a little <span aria-label="151" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg151" role="doc-pagebreak"/>deeper into China’s hyper-evolution in the aftermath of 2008.</p>
<p id="tec0000299">As mentioned at the start of the chapter, when the bottom fell out of Wall Street, China stabilised global capitalism by cranking up domestic investment to more than half of China’s national income. It worked, in that Chinese investment took up much of the global slack caused by Western commitment to austerity.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_3" id="chapter006_en3" role="doc-noteref">3</a> China’s international stature rose, and its accumulating dollar surpluses allowed Beijing, in addition to feeding Wall Street, to become a major investor in Africa, Asia, even in Europe through its famed Belt and Road Initiative. (There was a price, of course, for this sparkling new role: to elevate investment to such heights, Chinese workers’ share of the pie had to decline while Chinese rentiers, operating within China’s own FIRE sector, got seriously richer. Specifically, investment rose on the back of loans using as collateral land that China’s local authorities made available to developers. Thus, the post-2008 investment drive went hand in hand with the inflation of house and land prices across China.)</p>
<p id="tec0000300">In the same way that cloud capital rose in the US on the back of central bank monies from the Fed, so the same occurred in China on the back of Beijing’s investment drive. Silicon Valley’s Big Tech soon discovered a mighty competitor: China’s Big Tech. Westerners underestimate it. We think of Baidu as a Chinese Google knock-off. Of Alibaba as an Amazon imitator. They are much more than that. Indeed, to grasp the enormity and nature of China’s Big Five cloudalist conglomerates – Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, Ping An and JD.com – consider the following thought experiment.</p>
<p id="tec0000301">Imagine if, in the West, we were to roll into one Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and the version of Chinese-owned TikTok still available to American users. Then include <span aria-label="152" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg152" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the applications that play the role that telephone companies used to: Skype, WhatsApp, Viber, Snapchat. Add to the mix ecommerce cloudalists like Amazon, Spotify, Netflix, Disney Plus, Airbnb, Uber and Orbitz. Lastly, throw in PayPal, Charles Schwab and every other Wall Street bank’s own app. Now we are getting close. Except there is more …</p>
<p id="tec0000302">Unlike Silicon Valley’s Big Tech, China’s is directly bound into government agencies that make all-pervading use of this cloudalist agglomeration: to regulate urban life, to promote financial services to unbanked citizens, to link its people with state health care facilities, to conduct surveillance of them using facial recognition, to guide autonomous vehicles through the streets – and, outside of its borders, to connect Africans and Asians participating in China’s Belt and Road Initiative to its super cloud fief.</p>
<p id="tec0000303">The key here is the seamless integration of communication, entertainment, ecommerce, foreign investments and much else with online financial services: the portal to cloud rent. As I write this sentence,<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_4" id="chapter006_en4" role="doc-noteref">4</a> WeChat, the mobile messaging app belonging to Tencent, has transmitted 38 billion messages in a single day. Its users did not have to exit the WeChat app to make a payment. While streaming music, scrolling social media, messaging their families, they are able to use the same app to send money to anyone in China, as well as to any of the millions outside of China who have downloaded WeChat and opened a yuan account with any number of China’s banks.</p>
<p id="tec0000304">With this great leap into financial services, China’s cloudalists acquired a 360-degree view of their users’ social and financial life. If cloud capital is a produced means of behaviour modification, Chinese cloudalists have accumulated cloud capital beyond the wildest dreams of their Silicon <span aria-label="153" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg153" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Valley competitors who, by comparison, enjoy far less power per capita to accumulate cloud rent. American Big Tech has been doing what it can to catch up.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_5" id="chapter006_en5" role="doc-noteref">5</a> But it is becoming worryingly apparent to America’s rulers that China’s cloudalists have already acquired a power that US cloudalists are struggling to emulate: the power stemming from a successful merger of cloud capital and finance – or <em>cloud finance</em>.</p>
<p id="tec0000305">This is technofeudalism-with-Chinese-characteristics. Since its emergence, it was only ever going to be a matter of time before the geopolitical struggle for hegemony between the US and China would divide the world into two, conflicting, super cloud fiefs.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000306"><em>Technofeudal geopolitics: The emerging ‘threat’ of China’s cloud finance</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000307">People often ask when the dollar’s reign will end – and whether it might even be replaced by the Chinese yuan as the world’s reserve currency. But this question neglects a crucial fact: the dollar’s reign has suited most countries, including China, just fine.</p>
<p id="tec0000308">It has allowed countries with large trade surpluses, like China and Germany, to convert their excess production – their net exports – into property and rents in the United States: real estate, US government bonds, and any companies that Washington allowed them to own. Without the dollar’s global role, Chinese, Japanese, Korean or German capitalists would never have been able to extract such colossal surplus value from their workers and then stash it away somewhere safe. Michael Pettis, an economist who has been working and teaching in Beijing for many years, put it brilliantly:</p>
<blockquote id="tec0000309">
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000310"><span aria-label="154" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg154" role="doc-pagebreak"/>While the US dollar may create an exorbitant privilege for certain American constituencies, this status creates an exorbitant burden for the US economy overall, especially for the vast majority of Americans who must pay for the corresponding trade deficits either with higher unemployment, more household debt, or greater fiscal deficits.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_6" id="chapter006_en6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent" id="tec0000311">It is a fallacy, therefore, to think that the dollar’s only defender is the US. Anyone who tried to end the dollar’s reign would be equally resisted by German industrialists, Saudi sheikhs and European bankers. The last thing French and Dutch exporters would want to see is the elevation of the euro to the dollar’s throne. The only governments who have ever truly desired the dollar’s demise are those directly threatened by Washington’s attempts at regime change.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_7" id="chapter006_en7" role="doc-noteref">7</a> As for the people, the one population who stand to gain the most from the abolition of the dollar’s global role are working- and middle-class Americans.</p>
<p id="tec0000312">The fact that the Dark Deal between the US and China relied entirely on the dollar’s ongoing status meant that Washington had no reason to feel threatened by China’s rise. If anything, American officials saw it as functional to US hegemony. As long as Chinese capitalists needed the dollar in order to extract surplus value from Chinese workers, even the Chinese Communist Party was considered an ally, albeit an unsafe one. However, the rise of cloud capital changed everything.</p>
<p id="tec0000313">Compare a ton of aluminium shipped from Shanghai to Los Angeles with the targeted advertisements shown to Americans on the Chinese-owned social medium TikTok. Both yield dollars for a Chinese company. The difference is that the first bundle of dollars depends on a lump of metal <span aria-label="155" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg155" role="doc-pagebreak"/>produced in China physically migrating to America whereas the dollars earned by TikTok on US soil require no such physical migration. Let’s see why that’s the case and how in this difference lies the crux of cloud capital’s geostrategic significance.</p>
<p id="tec0000314">To produce an additional ton of Chinese aluminium for export to America, Chinese capitalists need an American customer to be willing to pay a sum of dollars that will cover the cost of the necessary energy and bauxite plus a profit. Given the limited sales of US goods to China, that American customer would not be forthcoming if the US did not have a trade deficit with China. Additionally, America would not be able to maintain this trade deficit without the dollar’s global dominance. In short, for the said ton of aluminium to ship from China to some port on America’s west coast, two things are necessary: the dollar’s exorbitant privilege and the red ink all over America’s trade balance with China.</p>
<p id="tec0000315">TikTok, in contrast, has no need for additional dollars from American customers in order to produce new products for its US market. With its servers, algorithms and fibre optic cables already in place, produced and maintained by domestic Chinese monies, throwing one more viral video to its American customer base comes at zero additional (or marginal) cost. This is crucial: TikTok can, therefore, syphon cloud rents from the US market into China without relying on either America’s trade deficit or the dollar’s supremacy. Without a need for dollars to create its cloud capital, TikTok uses it to rake in its dollar-denominated cloud rents directly, seamlessly and at the speed of light. Power, thus, is shifting in a way that reduces the value of the Dark Deal to America’s ruling class and state.</p>
<p id="tec0000316">As Chinese cloud capital grows in relation to terrestrial <span aria-label="156" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg156" role="doc-pagebreak"/>capital, China’s rich and powerful find themselves less and less subject to the US authorities’ power to regulate Chinese goods passing through their ports. So it was only a matter of time before Washington would attempt to restore the Dark Deal’s waning benefits for US business and government. The Trump administration crossed the Rubicon with its almost total ban on technology companies Huawei and ZTE as well as a move effectively to Americanise TikTok by banning its availability for further download from US app stores.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_8" id="chapter006_en8" role="doc-noteref">8</a> Its motivation was only very thinly disguised with the usual invocation of ‘national security’ concerns. Scratch the surface and the real motivation emerges: a serious – and not illogical – concern for the threat to Wall Street and Silicon Valley posed by the rise of Chinese cloud finance, which tilts the comparative advantages of the Dark Deal away from America’s and towards China’s ruling class. Compared to the original Cold War, the New Cold War has little politics behind it. Just naked technofeudal class interests.</p>
<p id="tec0000317">Still, the Dark Deal was not in immediate peril as long as the dollar remained the world’s indispensable IOU allowing wealthy non-Americans access to US property and rents. After all, what else could the Chinese cloudalists do with all the dollars they reaped in cloud rent from the United States, Europe and across the world? Their dependence on access to US markets gave the Trump administration confidence that the Chinese would accept, without much pushback, restrictions on their cloud capital’s power and reach.</p>
<p id="tec0000318">In a way, Trump was trying to do to China what Reagan had done to Japan in 1985 under the so-called Plaza Accord, which forced it to devalue the yen massively and, thus, to limit the capacity of Japanese exporters to profit from American sales and, more broadly, from the US trade deficit. The <span aria-label="157" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg157" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Japanese government’s acquiescence had been swift and silent, leading Japanese capitalism into a permanent slump from which it never truly recovered.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_9" id="chapter006_en9" role="doc-noteref">9</a> Would China react differently?</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000319"><em>Technofeudal geopolitics: How Ukraine helped divide the world into two super cloud fiefs</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000320">As Trump was to find out, China was no Japan. Being outside of America’s defence umbrella, its soil free of giant US army bases like the one in Okinawa, Beijing felt none of the need to defer to Washington that Tokyo revealed in 1985. Crucially, China also had its own Big Tech to bolster its position, especially its impressive cloud finance capabilities. Unsurprisingly, faced with Trump’s aggressive move, China held its own within the Dark Deal and continued to recycle Chinese profits into American assets. Not only did Beijing not succumb to pressure to revalue the yuan (as Japan had ruinously agreed to do with the yen), its Big Tech conglomerates, like Huawei and ZET, licked their significant wounds and set about creating their own operating system and platform software. Despite the great costs involved, China’s rulers understood that their future relied on not handing over their cloud capital, and of course their cloud finance, to America. And so, well into Biden’s first year in the White House, the Dark Deal between Chinese capitalists and American rentiers limped on.</p>
<p id="tec0000321">Then Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine and in response America did something that changed the whole equation. In retaliation to Putin’s aggression, the Federal Reserve froze hundreds of billions of dollars that belonged to Russia’s <span aria-label="158" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg158" role="doc-pagebreak"/>central bank but kept within the dollar-payment circuit that the US controls fully. It was the first time in capitalist history that a major central bank’s money had been, effectively, confiscated by another central bank.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_10" id="chapter006_en10" role="doc-noteref">10</a> Even during the Crimean War of the 1850s, as Russian and British soldiers were slaughtering each other, the Bank of England continued to honour financial commitments to the Czar’s central bank and Russian debtors kept paying their loan instalments to English bankers.</p>
<p id="tec0000322">Try putting yourself in the shoes of Chinese capitalists, or China’s finance minister, whose savings are in the form of dollar assets worth trillions: US Treasury Bills (i.e. loans to the American government), real estate in California, shares and derivatives in the New York money markets. Everyone knew that the US government could confiscate the lot at any time, but no one believed Washington would ever dare to, because such a move would deter anyone from ever stashing their wealth within the US-controlled dollar payments system again. Then the inconceivable happened: four days after Putin’s troops invaded Ukraine, Washington seized more than $300 billion belonging to Russia’s central bank and evicted anyone transacting through Russia’s central bank from all international payment systems.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_11" id="chapter006_en11" role="doc-noteref">11</a> Would you still be comfortable with trillions of dollars’ worth of your assets in US hands? But what could you do?</p>
<p id="tec0000323">If you are Russia, or Germany for that matter, there is nothing much you can do if Washington decides to grab your stash and evict you from all international payment systems. How about selling your exports in your own currency, emulating Putin who demanded to be paid for Russia’s oil and gas in roubles? It may sound like a solution, except it is not. Who will want to sell their computers or cars to <span aria-label="159" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg159" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Russians in roubles, other than the very few foreign capitalists who have an eye on some Russian asset (e.g. a dacha, a factory or a local bank)? Even German exporters, who earn massive amounts of euros from selling in Spain or France or Italy, have a problem finding euro-denominated assets that they want to own.</p>
<p id="tec0000324">What if you are China? Again, even though your economy’s size and depth mean that many foreign capitalists will crave some of your assets enough to accept yuan, you still have a problem: if you are a Chinese capitalist cut off from the dollar, you will not be able to benefit from America’s trade deficit; to use it as a vacuum cleaner that sucks into the American markets your aluminium, cement, electric vehicles and snazzy clothes. However, recall that this is a problem for Chinese capitalists but not so much for Chinese cloudalists (like TikTok) who had already built cloud finance up into an alternative global payment system. With it in hand, what is a serious problem for Chinese capitalists – i.e. the possible end of the dollar’s reign – poses no threat to Chinese cloudalists.</p>
<p id="tec0000325">China’s cloudalists were not the only people in the country eroding the Dark Deal. On 14 August 2020, a revolution took place inside the walls of the People’s Bank of China. Following six years of painstaking research, Beijing’s central bank rolled out a digital yuan – in experimental form but with serious intent. For the first time, anywhere, a state had issued a fully digital currency. ‘So what?’ I hear you say. ‘We all use digital money all the time.’ Well, yes, but this was something altogether different.</p>
<p id="tec0000326">When you pay for your coffee or train ticket using a smartphone app or a microchip-equipped debit card, these conventional digital payments go through the infrastructure <span aria-label="160" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg160" role="doc-pagebreak"/>of private banks. What China had created was digital money issued directly by a central bank, cutting out these middlemen, the private bankers. To see the global significance of this, consider Jürgen, a Hamburg-based factory owner using raw materials supplied by Xiu’s factory in Guangzhou to manufacture ship propellers, which Jürgen then sells to a shipyard owned by Ai near Shanghai.</p>
<p id="tec0000327">To wire payment for his raw materials to Xiu, Jürgen visits his German bank’s website, fills out the necessary digital form and presses Enter. The specified number of euros leaves his bank for the Bundesbank, Germany’s central bank, before passing through to the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. The European Central Bank then converts Jürgen’s euros to US dollars which it subsequently channels to the People’s Bank of China via a US-controlled international circuit. Once at the People’s Bank of China, its functionaries convert the money into yuan and wire it to Xiu’s bank. Finally, Xiu’s bank credits his account.</p>
<p id="tec0000328">Exactly the same clunky process is activated, in reverse, when Ai pays Jürgen for the propellers his shipyard buys from him. Is there a reason why such an unwieldy process has survived the wonders of the digital age? Of course there is: its clunkiness and mind-boggling inefficiency is a source of rent as each private banker and go-between involved in such transfers takes a small cut. Taken together, these small cuts amount to a fortune.</p>
<p id="tec0000329">Compare this with what would happen if Jürgen, Xiu and Ai were to obtain the new digital wallets now on offer by the People’s Bank of China: Jürgen would pick up his smartphone, open the digital yuan app, send a sum of digital yuan to Xiu who would receive it instantaneously and at zero cost. End of story! Think of all the middlemen the digital <span aria-label="161" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg161" role="doc-pagebreak"/>yuan cuts out: Jürgen’s German bank, the Bundesbank, the European Central Bank and, crucially, the international money transfer conduit which is fully under the thumb of US authorities. It is nothing less than Washington’s, and the private bankers’, worst nightmare.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_12" id="chapter006_en12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></p>
<p id="tec0000330">Before 2022, Chinese cloud finance and the digital yuan resembled a brand-new road with little traffic. Why would the ultra-wealthy of the world direct their money through a yuan-paved road, policed by the People’s Bank of China, when they could use the existing, albeit bumpy, dollar-built superhighway? A good reason appeared soon after the first explosions over Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol: the aforementioned seizure by America of hundreds of billions of dollars belonging to Russia’s central bank.</p>
<p id="tec0000331">Blocked from the dollar superhighway, Russian money began to use the under-utilised, glistening Chinese alternative. And it was not just Russian money that chose this new route. Many wealthy non-Russians, too, felt reluctant to continue letting their money race down the dollar freeway. They began to question the wisdom of relying entirely on the kindness of Washington’s dollar-traffic rangers, who could pull them over any time. Little by little, they began diversifying, like trucking companies redirecting some of their trucks from an older highway through a new one. In this way, Chinese cloud finance began little by little to establish itself as a viable alternative to the dollar-based international payments system.</p>
<p id="tec0000332">Smart people in and around the Biden administration saw the writing on the wall. For the first time since 1971, the Dark Deal looked shaky. The dollar’s supremacy could no longer be taken for granted either by the world’s wealthy or by American policymakers. Many in Washington felt that, if they failed to clip the wings of China’s Big Tech quickly, <span aria-label="162" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg162" role="doc-pagebreak"/>before its cloud finance and digital state money achieved critical mass, the exorbitant power of American rentier capitalists was in jeopardy.</p>
<p id="tec0000333">And so it was that on 7 October 2022, under the guise of national security concerns over China’s development of sophisticated weaponry, President Biden declared a total export ban on anything that might help China develop top-notch microchips. Since microchips are the building blocks of any advanced economy, and the ban on selling chips to China extended to non-American companies that wanted to do business with American ones, Biden’s ban amounted to total economic war.</p>
<p id="tec0000334">The intent was crystal clear: a shock-and-awe assault aimed at Chinese cloud finance, hoping to wound it critically before it could grow into a fully-fledged beast able to withstand, even to defeat, the combined forces of Silicon Valley and Wall Street. Will it work? Biden’s microchip ban will, in the short term, slow down China’s technological progress and impinge on the accumulation of Chinese cloud capital. However, it also has two unintended consequences, both working in the opposite direction to bolster Chinese cloud capital in the long term.</p>
<p id="tec0000335">The first unintended consequence of Biden’s ban was to motivate Chinese officials fully to bank on China’s cloud finance – something they had previously been reluctant to do. Why were they reluctant? Because they were invested in China’s export-led growth, which relied on the profits that Chinese capitalists drew from the American trade deficit as part of the Dark Deal. Anything that threatened those profits, including domestic cloud rent, was looked at askance. Until, of course, Biden unceremoniously confronted Beijing with a stark choice: ditch the Dark Deal or stay in the <span aria-label="163" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg163" role="doc-pagebreak"/>technological Dark Ages. It was a no-brainer: they would ditch the Dark Deal, if they had to, and shift their allegiance from China’s capitalists, who depend on the Dark Deal, to China’s cloudalists, who can rake in cloud rents without it.</p>
<p id="tec0000336">The second unintended consequence of Biden’s ban was to inspire capitalists and rentiers from across the world, including Western Europe, to flock to China’s cloud finance. Consider again Jürgen, our friend from Hamburg whose business is inextricably linked with the Chinese markets. He may be a loyal citizen of the Federal Republic, proud of Berlin’s alliance with Washington, and a committed free-market liberal with no sympathy for the Chinese Communist Party or the People’s Bank of China. Nonetheless, every time he reads in the newspapers about Washington’s sanctions and overall hardening stance towards China, he is motivated to acquire a digital yuan account to overcome future obstacles in making and receiving the payments that are crucial to his propeller export business.</p>
<p id="tec0000337">It is not the first time that war has sped up, but also skewed, historic transformations. The Second World War paved the way to the dollar taking over from the British pound the dominant role in international payments (Arab oil, for example, was swiftly re-denominated from pounds to dollars). The war in Ukraine prompted the United States to make moves which diverted considerable money flows from the dollar-based payments system to a yuan-based system run by Chinese cloud capital. As we speak, Chinese cloud rents accumulate, further overshadow Chinese capitalist profits, accelerate China’s transition to technofeudalism and, crucially, weaken the Dark Deal between the world’s two superpowers.</p>
<p id="tec0000338">The repercussions of all this for war and peace, international tensions and cooperation, cannot be underestimated. <span aria-label="164" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg164" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Focusing out of our present circumstances for a moment, so as to grasp the larger picture, it is worth recalling how, soon after it was born, and despite its youth and vibrancy, capitalism demonstrated an inherent inability to generate domestic markets sizeable enough to absorb all of the goods that local capitalist industries were producing.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_13" id="chapter006_en13" role="doc-noteref">13</a> The result was aggressive expansion overseas – a new type of imperialism motivated not so much by an urge to plunder faraway lands but to secure and corner faraway markets for the commodities produced domestically. As several capitalist nations competed for the same turf, in Africa, Asia and the Americas, these neocolonialist conflicts led to the repulsive blood-letting of the late nineteenth-century in Europe and ultimately, in the first half of the twentieth, to two world wars. Capitalism’s rise, in short, inspired industrial-scale carnage at a planetary scale.</p>
<p id="tec0000339">What should we expect, today, during technofeudalism’s early phases? We already have hints of what is to come. Under the spell of the war in Ukraine and the Great Inflation, which are enhancing poverty, climate change and an atmosphere of fear, the world is dividing into two, mutually antagonistic, super cloud fiefs – one American, the other Chinese. Little that is good and worthy will come of this bifurcation.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000340"><em>The spectre of technofeudalism over Europe, the Global South, the planet</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000341">Remember how, in 1971, President Nixon told his European counterparts ‘Our dollar is now your problem’? History could not have backed him more resoundingly.</p>
<p id="tec0000342">After 1971, American capitalism generated successive crises: <span aria-label="165" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg165" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the oil crises of 1973 and 1979, the global debt crisis after Fed chairman Paul Volcker pushed US interest rates above 20 per cent in 1981, the 1991 crisis following the bursting of several bubbles in US financial networks, the 2001 dot.com debacle and, last but not least, the crash of 2008.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_14" id="chapter006_en14" role="doc-noteref">14</a> It was in the nature of the beast – the Minotaur, that is – which was diverting to America more than 70 per cent of European and Asian capitalists’ profits. Every such crisis left Europe weaker, more divided, more reactionary.</p>
<p id="tec0000343">It was not for lack of trying. In reaction to each shockwave crossing the Atlantic, European leaders did their utmost to shield Europe from the next one. Their approach was to expand and consolidate Europe’s institutions and resources, leading ultimately to the establishment of a single shared currency.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_15" id="chapter006_en15" role="doc-noteref">15</a> Why did these various projects – all aimed at liberating Europe from its vulnerability to America’s rentier economy – end up failing? The answer is not particularly complicated: the reason is the European Union’s total dependence on its own Dark Deal with America. It is the same reason why the smartest of the most powerful of Europeans – German, Dutch and French exporters – have no interest in seeing the euro knock the dollar off its reserve currency throne. It is why Europe’s monetary union remains incomplete-by-design.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_16" id="chapter006_en16" role="doc-noteref">16</a> Simply, while they may wish to protect themselves from its shifts and shocks, they have no actual desire to be free of their pact with the US, which allows European capitalists to profit from the demand generated by America’s trade deficit and to turn these profits into US assets.</p>
<p id="tec0000344">Could anything worse afflict a Europe dependent on the Dark Deal than the Dark Deal’s demise? Yes, there is something even worse: the gradual, worldwide shift of money and <span aria-label="166" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg166" role="doc-pagebreak"/>power from the capitalist to the cloudalist sphere. If my hypothesis is right, that cloud capital is overpowering terrestrial capital, sucking cloud rent increasingly out of the global value chain, then Europe is in deep trouble. Because Europe is not China. It lacks a single Big Tech company that can compete with those of Silicon Valley and its financial systems are wholly reliant on Wall Street. Europe’s lack of cloud capital means that the New Cold War, along with the energy shock<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_17" id="chapter006_en17" role="doc-noteref">17</a> that the war in Ukraine inflicted upon its manufacturers, has already rendered Europe geostrategically irrelevant.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_18" id="chapter006_en18" role="doc-noteref">18</a></p>
<p id="tec0000345">At least Europe is still rich and, in theory, able to look after its weaker citizens. The same cannot be said for Sri Lanka, Lebanon, Pakistan, India, most of Asia and the whole of Africa and Latin America. The rising price of food and fuel caused by the Great Inflation has pushed the Global South into a debt crisis as gruesome as that of the 1970s and 80s. Having been encouraged for decades to borrow dollars to import raw materials in order to produce goods for export (and also to facilitate the conversion of their oligarchs’ domestic profits into US assets), the governments of the Global South are now being bankrupted by the vastly increased cost of servicing their dollar debts.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_19" id="chapter006_en19" role="doc-noteref">19</a></p>
<p id="tec0000346">The Global South faces an appalling choice. Default on their dollar debts, which means they won’t be able to buy the energy, food and raw materials they need to feed their people, run their factories and plough their fields. Or get another dollar loan from, say, the International Monetary Fund with which they can pretend to repay their existing dollar loans under two inhuman conditions: first, by handing over control of their essential sectors, such as water, electricity, to oligarchs masquerading as ‘investors’; second, by pushing domestic fuel and food prices up so high that their people <span aria-label="167" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg167" role="doc-pagebreak"/>will go hungry. Either way, these so-called developing countries are being forced to surrender to the dynamic of underdevelopment.</p>
<p id="tec0000347">But this is not the only dreadful choice that Global South governments must make. With the world dividing into two super cloud fiefs, one dollar-based and another yuan-based, they are being forced to choose which feudal lord to submit to. Gone are the days when their oligarchs could borrow from China, or collect profits from selling grain in Shanghai, and use the money to buy properties in California or derivatives in Wall Street. Their new debt crisis is forcing the Global South’s ruling classes to pick a side. To which cloud fief will they commit future earnings from the selling of their rare earths and other raw materials? Will they still rely on Wall Street? Or will they channel their profits and rents through China’s cloud finance? Either way, the Global South is being divided, escalating the New Cold War further.</p>
<p id="tec0000348">This is much more than neocolonial business-as-usual. Chinese and American capital have been at loggerheads for years. Except that, now, it is no longer a competition based on the prices of commodities or the comparative desirability of different vendor financing offers.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_20" id="chapter006_en20" role="doc-noteref">20</a> This is a titanic battle over as yet virgin technofeudal territory on which two systems of cloud-rent extraction wish to establish themselves as overlords. It will take a miracle for this recently evolved species of imperialism not to result in more wars and more failed states.</p>
<p id="tec0000349">Speaking of miracles: given capitalism’s inherent tendency to deplete the commons, it was always going to take an enormous one for our species to escape climate catastrophe. Technofeudalism’s advance makes this miracle even more improbable. The Age of Cloud Capital erects two obstacles <span aria-label="168" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg168" role="doc-pagebreak"/>in the path of climate change amelioration. One obstacle operates at the level of politics and is obvious. A grand deal between the United States, the European Union, China (not to mention Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa) is a prerequisite for limiting climate warming to levels consistent with our species’ survival. In the shadow of this New Cold War, the best we can now hope for are two separate green transitions, one in each super cloud fief – a bifurcation of the global green agenda which, I fear, will play into the hands of fossil fuel conglomerates who will find ways to play one off against the other, allowing them to keep drilling.</p>
<p id="tec0000350">The less obvious obstacle technofeudalism throws in the path of any green transition are the so-called electricity ‘markets’. I say ‘so-called’ because they are not, and can never be, actual markets. Think about it: only one electricity cable enters your home or business. It is <em>the</em> definition of a natural monopoly. Naturally, if governments were to advocate that such a monopoly be sold to a privateer, who would then have monopoly power over everyone, people would rise up. So, following Margaret Thatcher’s lead, governments intent on privatisation promised magically to create competitive electricity markets around the single grid and the lone cable coming out of your wall: a handful of energy providers, the promise went, would compete in some auction house daily to provide you with the cheapest possible electricity. These pretend auction markets, in which a handful of firms collude to fleece consumers and lesser capitalists, are a rentier capitalist’s delight. (Exhibit A: their immense profits during the energy crisis following the pandemic and Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.) But that’s not all. The rentiers that now own the privatised power generation stations gamble their future revenues in a global casino, borrowing against future revenues <span aria-label="169" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg169" role="doc-pagebreak"/>in order to hedge against future losses.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_21" id="chapter006_en21" role="doc-noteref">21</a> In plainer terms, our energy systems have been surrendered to oligarchs with a vested interest to entangle energy in the web of financialisation. As this web becomes increasingly fused into cloud finance, we forfeit what is left of our capacity as a demos (a community, a society, a species) to choose the energy practices that might avert climate disaster.</p>
<p id="tec0000351">It is why I am anxious to convey, especially to the young, the disturbing news that the greater the power of the cloudalist class, and the faster the march of technofeudalism, the less we, the demos, can do to avert climate catastrophe. The young, who are at the forefront of ‘striking for the future’, must recognise that preventing our planet’s overheating goes hand in hand with resisting technofeudalism.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000352"><em>Back to your question: who wins and who loses?</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000353">As a young man, you had hoped organised labour would vanquish capitalism at a planetary scale. As an older man, you witnessed exactly the opposite: capitalism’s unhindered globalisation.</p>
<p id="tec0000354">After 1991, two things globalised: financial capital, which could jump continents at the push of a button, and production lines, or chains, which made it possible for American iPhones, engineered by Indian developers in San Francisco, and built by a Taiwanese company in Zhengzhou, to be sold in Philadelphia. Around two and a half billion labourers, mainly from China, India and the formerly communist countries, joined this international value chain, lifting many of them out of poverty. But the headline-generating rises in measurable incomes were often bought at the price of sheer <span aria-label="170" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg170" role="doc-pagebreak"/>grief.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_22" id="chapter006_en22" role="doc-noteref">22</a> Chinese migrant labourers, working sixteen-hour shifts in abominable sweatshops to produce iPhones, saw their incomes quadruple but became almost as suicidal as Indian farmers whose livelihoods were destroyed when their crops became dependent on Bayer-Monsanto’s genetically engineered seeds.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_23" id="chapter006_en23" role="doc-noteref">23</a> Even in America, the greatest beneficiary of globalisation, millions succumbed to deaths of despair.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_24" id="chapter006_en24" role="doc-noteref">24</a> These contradictions were the direct consequence of the Dark Deal. By mobilising America’s trade deficit to turn China into a capitalist powerhouse, enriching capitalists and rentiers worldwide, underinvestment-induced misery migrated to the Global North while overinvestment-induced wealth migrated to the Global South.</p>
<p id="tec0000355">Two years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, as globalisation was gathering pace, you asked the question that motivated this book, betraying your stubborn hope that capitalism might not last forever. Some thirty years later, as I have argued, your wish has been granted – the internet has indeed proved capitalism’s undoing – though not in the way you might have expected. If I am right, the question now becomes: who are the winners and who the losers from this transformation of capitalist globalisation into a worldwide technofeudalism?</p>
<p id="tec0000356">Throughout the capitalist era, nothing good has happened when rentiers have succeeded in creaming off increasing portions of capitalists’ profits. Profit’s conversion into rent has always hindered capitalism’s dynamic, created bubbles that burst, and plunged weaker people and states into toxic debt. The rise of technofeudalism has taken this crisis-producing process to new heights – to a state of <em>poly-crisis</em>, to borrow the neologism economic historian Adam Tooze concocted out of two Greek words.</p>
<p id="tec0000357"><span aria-label="171" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg171" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Think of those billions of cloud serfs who are, at this very moment, putting so much time and energy into building up someone else’s cloud capital. Their unpaid labour produces extractive power and cloud rent for very few cloudalists, money that will never re-enter the wider circulation of income, while earning them no income themselves. Allow me to describe this as the <em>shrinking of the global value base</em>. Add to this the wage squeeze that cloud capital also imposes on waged workers, as it increasingly turns them into cloud proles. The result is a substantial reduction in the incomes that the masses can mobilise to buy commodities. This secular drop in effective, or aggregate, demand means more and deeper economic crises. To use an ecological metaphor, capitalists and workers are experiencing something akin to the shrinking of their habitat, pushing endangered species into greater peril, while suffering more frequent extreme weather events.</p>
<p id="tec0000358">That was the state of play before the war in Ukraine. Since Washington’s decision to wage war on Chinese Big Tech, and its cloud finance, in a manner that puts paid to the Dark Deal and divides the world into a dollar-based cloud fief and a yuan-based cloud fief, Chinese and American workers are certain to suffer but American rentiers and Chinese capitalists have much to lose as well. If Chinese surplus value no longer migrates at the same rate to the United States, America’s rentiers will be in trouble. Their misfortune will then ricochet back to hurt Chinese capitalists who are so very dependent on America’s net imports which are, in turn, maintained by dollar-denominated rents. As for American cloudalists, they can’t know what to expect: while they gain relative power over capitalists, and the rest of American society, the effect of the Dark Deal’s demise on their bottom line is the great unknowable.</p>
<p id="tec0000359"><span aria-label="172" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg172" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Companies like Apple and Tesla, which straddle terrestrial capital and cloud capital, will be surely hurt. Unlike, say, Google, Apple has invested billions in physical capital in China where it manufactures the iPhone and iPad. This is not an investment that it can repatriate easily into the United States. Apple is not manufacturing in China because of cheap, skilled labour but because, since 2007, it has built an entire ecosystem of manufacturing processes which blend human, terrestrial and cloud capital in ways that cannot be emulated on American soil. For companies that are more cloud-capital-intensive, like Amazon and Google, it will all depend on how the shrinking global value base, and the disruption of the flow of Chinese profits and rents into the dollar super cloud fief, will affect their sales.</p>
<p id="tec0000360">One thing we know for certain. Technological advancement will help cloud capital go from strength to strength. Once combined with large-scale, versatile, advanced 3D printing and AI-driven industrial robotics, cloud capital will undermine the whole point of traditional capitalist conglomerates, whose competitive advantage is based on economies of scale. Meanwhile, the de-globalisation of physical capital, triggered by Washington’s decision to wage economic war against China, will accelerate. And so will the antagonisms between the two super cloud fiefs over the plundering of raw materials – rare earths, lithium and, of course, our data – from around the world.</p>
<p id="tec0000361">The peak of globalisation, between 2005 and 2020, saw large fault lines develop within the world’s major trading blocks. One such fault line increasingly divided the European Union’s deficit countries in its south from its surplus countries in the north. Another fault line split America’s coastal economies from the rust belts in its middle. China’s <span aria-label="173" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg173" role="doc-pagebreak"/>booming coastal regions were divided from the interior of the mainland by an economic Berlin Wall. Are these fault lines subsiding now that globalisation is on the wane? Quite the opposite. Previous fault lines remain while new ones emerge, between the East and West of Europe, for example, and between Americans connected to cloudalist power and the rest. And as a consequence of the broader technofeudal bifurcation, the world is dividing into continental superstates, not unlike those clashing permanently in George Orwell’s <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_25" id="chapter006_en25" role="doc-noteref">25</a></p>
<p id="tec0000362">Peace is the obvious victim of this process but not the only one: given the magnitude and the nature of the power wielded by the very small band of cloudalists on both sides of the Pacific, anything resembling actual democracy seems increasingly far-fetched. Indeed, the great irony, from a Western perspective, is that the only political force that can do anything to keep the cloudalists in check and thus the hope of democracy alive is the Chinese Communist Party. It was President Xi who placed strict limits on Chinese cloudalists, like Jack Ma, in an explicit bid to keep China’s cloud finance within what the party considers to be acceptable bounds – its own.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter006_en_26" id="chapter006_en26" role="doc-noteref">26</a></p>
<p id="tec0000363">The great challenge for Xi, however, is that the party’s authority relies on economic growth, which has for so long been generated by the enrichment of its capitalists via the Dark Deal. In theory, and in a very roundabout way, Xi has declared a class war in the name of Chinese workers, not only on the cloudalists but on Chinese capitalists, too. In August 2021, he announced curbs on ‘excessive incomes’ and, crucially, a new policy to shrink aggregate investment from 50 per cent of Chinese national income to 30 per cent – something that can only happen if Chinese capitalist profits <span aria-label="174" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg174" role="doc-pagebreak"/>from net exports to the United States are reduced massively while domestic wages rise. But is this a real campaign or merely a propaganda drive, a form of populism with Chinese characteristics? Is China’s political class capable and willing to commit to a sustained clash with both cloudalists and capitalists? It is impossible to say. Indeed, even if Xi means what he says and succeeds in boosting working-class incomes, we have no way of knowing whether any rise in the majority’s incomes will reinvigorate the power of China’s demos. Nonetheless, it remains endlessly intriguing that the only glimmer of hope for any demos around the world shines in the midst of a society under totalitarianism.</p>
<p id="tec0000364">Liberals once feared people like you and me – leftists craving a socialist transformation. When the left was defeated, liberals were relieved but continued to rail against the power of the state: in their eyes, powerful states, even bourgeois liberal ones, are what pave the road to serfdom. Is it not delectably shocking how, in the end, a global superhighway to serfdom has been constructed not because Western states were too powerful but because they were too weak? Too weak, that is, to prevent the cloud capital they birthed from taking over, disestablishing capitalism and facilitating technofeudalism.</p>
