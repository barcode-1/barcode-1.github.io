<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001712">My father was the only leftie I know who failed to understand why calling Maggie Thatcher ‘The Iron Lady’ was somehow derogatory. And I must have been the only child raised to believe that gold was iron’s poorer cousin.</p>
<p id="tec0001713">My catechism in iron’s magical qualities began in the winter of 1966, which I recall as a bitterly cold one. In their haste to leave behind the cramped rented apartment where we were staying while our home in Paleo Phaliro, a coastal Athenian suburb, was being rebuilt, my parents moved us back into the not-quite-completed house in the midst of winter, before any central heating had been installed. Thankfully, Dad had insisted that our new living room feature a decent red-brick fireplace. It was there, in front of its warm glow, that over the course of several winter nights he introduced me, one at a time, to his friends, as he called them.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0001714"><em>Father’s friends</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001715">His friends arrived in a large grey sack that he brought home one evening from the ‘factory’, the steel plant in Eleusis where he would work as a chemical engineer for six decades. They were mightily unimpressive. Some looked like shapeless rocks, lumps of ore as I was to learn later. Others were equally uninspiring rods and metal plates of various shapes. If it weren’t for the loving manner in which he laid out each <span aria-label="2" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg2" role="doc-pagebreak"/>one of them on a folded white, hand-embroidered tablecloth in front of the fireplace, I would never have thought of them as special.</p>
<p id="tec0001716">Tin was the first friend he introduced me to. After giving me a piece to hold, to feel its softness, he placed it in an iron bowl which he then rested on the roaring fire. As the tin began to melt and the metallic liquid filled up the bowl, Dad’s eyes lit up. ‘All that is solid melts into liquid and, then, given enough heat, turns into steam. Even metals!’ Once he was confident I had appreciated the great transition from solid to liquid state, together we poured the liquid tin into a mould, immersed it in water to cool it down, and then broke the mould open so that I could, once again, take the tin in my hands to ascertain that our friend was back to normal – that it had been returned to its initial state.</p>
<p id="tec0001717">The following night we experimented with another friend: a longish rod made of bronze. This time there was no great transition, as bronze’s melting temperature is at least five times that of tin. Still, the rod began to glow a brilliant orangey red and Dad showed me how to give whatever shape I wanted to its hot tip with the help of a small steel hammer. Once I’d had enough, we immersed it in cold water also to return it, cool and unchanged, to its original, malleable, state.</p>
<p id="tec0001718">On the third night, Dad seemed more excited than ever. He was about to introduce me to his best friend, iron. To add tension to the moment, he removed his gold wedding ring from his finger and showed it to me. ‘See how gold gleams?’ he said. ‘Humans have always fallen for this metal because of its looks. What they don’t realise is that it is just that: flashy – not special.’ If I wanted, he would be happy to demonstrate that when gold is heated up and then immersed in water to <span aria-label="3" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg3" role="doc-pagebreak"/>cool it down again, it returns, like tin and bronze, to its prior state. Glad that I did not insist on a demonstration, he moved on to his favourite part.</p>
<p id="tec0001719">Holding up a piece of iron ore and gazing at the insipid lump like Hamlet contemplating Yorick’s skull, Dad pronounced: ‘Now, if you want a truly magical substance, this is it: iron. The Wizard of Materials.’ And then he proceeded to back up his claim by subjecting an iron rod to the same torture we had inflicted on the bronze rod the previous night, but with a couple of crucial differences.</p>
<p id="tec0001720">Before heating up the iron, I was given a chance to hammer at its tip, to ascertain that it was soft and almost as malleable as bronze. Once in the fireplace, a small bellows helped us fan the flames until the iron’s glow had turned the dimly lit living room scarlet. We took the rod out of the fireplace and, with the little hammer, shaped it into something that, in my boyish eyes, looked like a sword. Lowering it into the cold water made the iron hiss as if in triumph. ‘Poor Polyphemus!’ Father remarked mysteriously.</p>
<p id="tec0001721">‘Heat it up again,’ he said. I put the rod back into the fire. ‘This time immerse it in the water <em>before</em> it glows.’ Excited by the hissing iron, I was glad that we repeated the ‘quenching’ process, as metallurgists call it, three or four times. Before I got a chance properly to admire my new sword, Dad announced that the moment of truth had arrived. ‘Pick up the hammer and deliver an almighty strike on the sword’s tip,’ he instructed.</p>
<p id="tec0001722">‘But I don’t want to ruin it,’ I protested.</p>
<p id="tec0001723">‘Go on, do it, you’ll see. Don’t spare your strength!’</p>
<p id="tec0001724">I didn’t. The hammer struck the sword’s tip and bounced right back. I struck it again and again. It made no difference. My sword was impervious to the blows. Hardened.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0001725"><em><span aria-label="4" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg4" role="doc-pagebreak"/>A child’s introduction to historical materialism</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001726">Father could not contain himself. What I had witnessed, he explained, was not a mere great transition – as with the tin that melted – but a great transformation. True, copper had facilitated our deliverance from prehistory: its ability to alloy with arsenic and tin to make the harder metal bronze gave the Mesopotamians, the Egyptians and the Achaeans new technologies, including new ploughs, axes and irrigation, allowing them ultimately to produce the large agricultural surpluses that funded the construction of splendid temples and murderous armies. But for history to accelerate sufficiently to bring about what we now call civilisation, humanity needed something much harder still than bronze. It needed its ploughs, its hammers and its metal structures to have the hardness of my sword’s tip. It needed to learn the trick I had seen in our living room: how to transform soft iron into hardened steel by ‘baptising’ it in cold water.</p>
<p id="tec0001727">Bronze Age communities that did not learn how to baptise iron perished, he insisted.</p>
<p id="tec0001728">The swords of their ironclad enemies sliced through their bronze shields, their ploughs failed to cultivate the less fertile soils, the metal braces holding together their dams and temples were too weak to fulfil the ambitions of forward-thinking architects. In contrast, communities that mustered the <em>techne</em>, the art, of ‘steeling’ iron thrived in the fields, on the battlefields, at sea, in commerce, in the arts. Iron’s magic underpinned the new role of technology as the driving force that led to civilisation and its discontents.</p>
<p id="tec0001729">Lest I doubted the cultural pertinence of our little experiment – and of the arrival of the Iron Age – Father <span aria-label="5" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg5" role="doc-pagebreak"/>explained his earlier reference to ‘poor Polyphemus’, the one-eyed giant who, according to Homer, imprisoned Odysseus and his men in a cave, taking his time to devour them one by one. To set them and himself free, Odysseus waited for Polyphemus to fall into a drunken stupor, heated up a wooden stake in the cave’s open fire and, aided by his comrades, shoved it into Polyphemus’ sole eye. ‘Remember the sound of the hissing iron?’ Dad asked. Well, Homer must have been equally impressed by it, judging by the verse in <em>The Odyssey</em> that captures the cruel moment:</p>
<blockquote id="tec0001730">
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001731">And as when a smith dips a great axe or an adze in cold water amid loud hissing to temper it – for therefrom comes the strength of iron – even so did his eye hiss round the stake of olive-wood.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter001_en_1" id="chapter001_en1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent" id="tec0001732">Odysseus and his contemporaries preceded the Iron Age and could not have known how iron’s hissing heralded a molecular hardening of historic significance. But Homer, who lived a couple of centuries after the Trojan War, was a child of the Iron Age, and thus came of age in the midst of the technological and social revolution that steel had wrought. In case I thought Homer was an outlier, Dad pointed to the lasting influence of iron’s magic by quoting Sophocles, who four centuries later described a soul as ‘hardened like immersed iron’.</p>
<p id="tec0001733">Prehistory gave its place to history, Father said, when bronze displaced stone tools and weapons. Once bronze became widespread after 4000 <span class="small_caps">BC</span>, powerful civilisations emerged in Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, India, Crete, Mycenae and elsewhere. But, still, history was counted in the millennia. To be counted in the centuries, we had to discover the magic of iron. Once the Iron Age got going, around the ninth century <span class="small_caps">BC</span>, <span aria-label="6" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg6" role="doc-pagebreak"/>three different and remarkable eras emerged in quick succession, within no more than seven centuries in total: the geometric period, the classical era and the Hellenistic civilisation.</p>
<p id="tec0001734">From the glacial speeds of the Bronze Age, humanity had been propelled to the breathless developments of the Iron Age. But for a long time, iron and steel remained too difficult to produce, too expensive. Even after the Industrial Revolution, the first steamships were mostly wooden, with steel providing only the essential components (boiler, chimney, joints). Enter another one of my father’s great heroes, Henry Bessemer, who invented a technique for producing large quantities of steel cheaply by blowing air through molten pig iron to burn off the impurities. It was then, according to Dad, that history accelerated to speeds with which we are familiar today. Coupled with the taming of electromagnetism, which we owe to another Victorian, James Maxwell, Bessemer’s technique gave us the Second Industrial Revolution – the period of rapid technological innovation from 1870 onwards, as distinct from the arrival of the factories earlier that century in the First Industrial Revolution – its wonders and horrors wrapped tightly together.</p>
<p id="tec0001735">Looking back to those few winter nights of 1966, it is now clear to me that I was being inducted in ‘historical materialism’ – the method of understanding history as a constant feedback loop between, on the one hand, the way humans transform matter and, on the other, the manner in which human thinking and social relations are transformed in return. Thankfully, Father’s historical materialism was nuanced, his enthusiasm for technology tempered by judicious doses of angst about humanity’s infinite capacity to mess things up, to turn miraculous technology into living hell.</p>
<p id="tec0001736">Iron, like all revolutionary technologies, had sped up history. <span aria-label="7" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg7" role="doc-pagebreak"/>But in which direction? For what purpose? With what effect on us? As Dad explained, from the very start of the Iron Age there were those who foresaw its tragic consequences. Hesiod was composing poetry at around the same time as Homer. His <em>Works and Days</em> had a salutary cooling influence on Dad’s enthusiasm for iron and, more generally, technology:</p>
<blockquote id="tec0001737">
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001738">I wish I did not have to live among the people of the Fifth Age [the Iron Age], but either had died earlier or been born later. For now truly is a generation of iron who never rest from labour and sorrow by day or from perishing by night … But, notwithstanding the good mingled with their evils … [this generation] will know no favour for those who keep their oath or for the just or for the good … strength shall be right … the wicked will hurt the worthy … bitter sorrows will be left for us mortals, and there will be no help against evil.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter001_en_2" id="chapter001_en2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent" id="tec0001739">According to Hesiod, iron hardened not only our ploughs but also our souls. Under its influence, our spirit was hammered and forged in fire, our brand-new desires quenched like the hissing metal in the smith’s cauldron. Virtues were tested and values destroyed just as our bounty burgeoned and our estates expanded. Strength begat new joys but weariness and injustices too. Zeus would have no choice, Hesiod foretold, but to one day destroy a humanity incapable of restraining its own, technologically induced, power.</p>
<p id="tec0001740">My father wanted to disagree with Hesiod. He wanted to believe that we humans could become the masters of our technology rather than enslave ourselves and one another with it. When Prometheus stole fire, symbolising the white heat of technology, from Zeus on humanity’s behalf, he did so in the hope that it would lighten up our lives without <span aria-label="8" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg8" role="doc-pagebreak"/>burning down the Earth. My father wanted to believe we could make Prometheus proud.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0001741"><em>From heat to light</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001742">An innate optimism was only one reason Dad remained hopeful that humanity would not waste the magical powers he had introduced me to in front of our fireplace. Another was his encounter with the nature of light.</p>
<p id="tec0001743">One time, as I was removing an iron rod from the fire, Dad asked: ‘Can you guess what leaves the heated-up metal to reach your eye so that you can see its red glow?’ I had no idea. Happily, I was not alone.</p>
<p id="tec0001744">For centuries, light had divided the best minds, he said. Some, like Aristotle and James Maxwell, thought of light as a kind of disturbance in the ether, a wave that spreads outwards from an initial source – like sound does. Others, such as Democritus and Isaac Newton pointed out that, unlike sound, light cannot bend round corners – something waves do by their very nature – and thus it must be made of tiny things, or particles, travelling in a straight line before hitting our eye’s retina. Who was right?</p>
<p id="tec0001745">My father’s life changed, or so he told me, when he read Albert Einstein’s answer: they were <em>all</em> right! Light is, at once, a stream of particles <em>and</em> a series of waves. But how could that be? Particles differ fundamentally from waves. They are located at only one point at any particular moment in time, they have momentum, and they move only in a straight line unless and until something gets in their way. Waves, by contrast, are oscillations of a medium, which is what allows them to turn corners and transport energy in many different <span aria-label="9" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg9" role="doc-pagebreak"/>directions at once. To prove, as Einstein had done, that light was both particles and waves was to admit that something can be two utterly contradictory things at once.</p>
<p id="tec0001746">For Dad, the dual nature of light was the gateway to recognising the essential dualism underlying all of nature, and also in society. ‘If light could be two very different things at once,’ he wondered in a letter he wrote as a young man to his mother, ‘if matter is energy and energy matter,’ as Einstein had also discovered, ‘why must we cast life either in black-and-white terms or, even worse, in some shade of grey?’</p>
<p id="tec0001747">By the time I was twelve or thirteen, it was clear to me from our ongoing conversations that Dad’s love for iron’s magic – technology – and for Einstein’s physics – the contradictory duality of all things – had something to do with his left-wing politics, for which he had spent several years in prison camps. My hunch was confirmed when I came across the text of a speech delivered by the same person who had first formulated the notion of historical materialism: Karl Marx. It was as if Dad had been speaking the words:</p>
<blockquote id="tec0001748">
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001749">In our days, everything seems pregnant with its contrary: Machinery, gifted with the wonderful power of shortening and fructifying human labour, we behold starving and overworking it; The newfangled sources of wealth, by some strange weird spell, are turned into sources of want; The victories of art seem bought by the loss of character.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter001_en_3" id="chapter001_en3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent" id="tec0001750">The power to shorten human labour and make it fruitful resulted from the great transformation of matter Father had been so keen to demonstrate for my benefit: iron turning to steel in our fireplace, heat turning to kinetic energy in James Watt’s miraculous fire engine, the minor miracles occurring <span aria-label="10" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg10" role="doc-pagebreak"/>within the telegraph’s magnets and cables. But ever since Hesiod’s Fifth Age, it was a power pregnant with its opposite as well: the power to starve and to overwork, to turn a source of wealth into a source of want.</p>
<p id="tec0001751">The link between Father’s twin devotions – to furnaces, metallurgy and technology in general on the one hand, and to his politics on the other – became impossible to miss when I first read <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>, in particular the line:</p>
<blockquote id="tec0001752">
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001753">All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter001_en_4" id="chapter001_en4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent" id="tec0001754">It brought back the memory of his childlike enthusiasm at the sight of melting metal in front of our fireplace or, far more spectacularly, at the steel plant whose quality control department he directed and where temperatures were high enough for iron literally to ‘melt into air’.</p>
<p id="tec0001755">But unlike Hesiod – or indeed the moralists of our own era – Dad did not feel he had to take sides, to be either a technophobe or a tech-enthusiast. If light can have two contradictory natures, and if all of nature rests on a binary opposition, then hardened iron, steam engines and networked computers could also be, simultaneously, potential liberators and enslavers. And so it is up to us, collectively, to determine which of the two it will be. That’s where politics comes in.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0001756"><em>A most peculiar introduction to capitalism</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001757">Leftists usually become radicalised in reaction to the vile injustices and mind-numbing inequality capitalism generates. <span aria-label="11" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg11" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Not so in my case. Sure, growing up in the midst of a fascist dictatorship played its role, but my leftism had far more esoteric origins: a sensitivity, given to me by my father, to the duality of things.</p>
<p id="tec0001758">Well before I read a word that Marx or any other economist had written, I thought I could discern several dualities buried deep in the foundations of our societies. My first inkling of such a duality hit me one evening when Mum complained to Dad that, at the fertiliser factory where she worked as a chemist, she got paid for her time but never for her enthusiasm. ‘My wage is crap because my time is cheap,’ she said. ‘My passion to get the right results the bosses get for free!’ Soon after, she resigned and got herself a job as a biochemist at a public hospital. A few months into the new job, she told us happily: ‘At least at the hospital I love that my efforts benefit patients, even if I am as invisible to them as I used to be to the factory owners.’</p>
<p id="tec0001759">Those words stuck with me. Mum had inadvertently introduced me to the duality of waged labour. The wage she was paid for her time and formal skills (her certificates, degrees) reflected the ‘exchange value’ of the hours she spent at work. But that’s not what injected true value into whatever was being manufactured in her workplace. That was added to what was produced at the factory or the hospital through her effort, enthusiasm, application, even flair – none of which were remunerated. It’s like going to watch a movie at a cinema: the ticket price you pay reflects the movie’s exchange value, but that is quite separate from the pleasure it gives you, which we might call the ‘experiential value’. In the same way, labour is split between commodity labour (Mum’s time, bought by her wage) and experiential labour (the effort, passion and flair she put into her work).</p>
<p id="tec0001760"><span aria-label="12" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg12" role="doc-pagebreak"/>When in time I did come to read Marx, I vividly recall how excited I was to discover that, thanks to my father’s fireside lessons and my mum’s explanation, I had stumbled upon one of the great economist’s central principles. In the world we take for granted today, labour seems like any other commodity. Desperate to make a living, people promote their skills like vendors advertising their wares. They accept a market-determined price (the wage) for their labour, which reflects its exchange value, i.e. what it is worth compared to other exchangeable commodities. This is commodity labour. However, as we have seen, unlike soap powder, potatoes or iPhones, which are nothing but commodities, labour is something else besides.</p>
<p id="tec0001761">To illustrate labour’s second nature, the experiential labour that my mother first alerted me to, consider the brilliant idea conjured up by a group of brainstorming architects employed by a multinational construction firm. Or the positive vibes a waiter emits on the restaurant floor. Or a teacher’s tear of joy when a challenged pupil solves a difficult maths problem. None of these can ever truly be commodified. Why? Because no monetary reward can prompt a moment of true inspiration, no genuine smile can be bought, no authentic tear can be shed for a price. In fact, any attempt to do so would immediately negate them. Indeed, bosses who try to quantify, price or commodify experiential labour will sound like the fool who yells at you: ‘Be spontaneous!’</p>
<p id="tec0001762">What I call experiential labour, the part which can never be sold, Marx called simply labour. And what I have labelled commodity labour, Marx defined as labouring power. But the idea is the same: ‘What the working man sells is not directly his Labour, but his Labouring Power, the temporary disposal of which he makes over to the capitalist.’<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter001_en_5" id="chapter001_en5" role="doc-noteref">5</a> Imagine <span aria-label="13" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg13" role="doc-pagebreak"/>my joy, then, when I discovered that, based on labour’s two natures, Marx had erected a whole theory of capitalism.</p>
<p id="tec0001763">For herein lies capitalism’s secret: the uncommodifiable sweat, effort, inspiration, goodwill, care and tears of employees are what breathe exchange value into the commodities that employers then flog to eager customers – this is actually what makes the building or restaurant or school desirable.</p>
<p id="tec0001764">One may protest that there is many a factory populated by uninspired, joyless, robotic workers producing tin cans or gadgets worth more than the cost of paying the workers. True. But this happens only because employers cannot buy the <em>effort</em> put in by unskilled, manual labourers. They can only buy their time, during which to pressurise them, in a variety of ways, to work hard and to sweat. The point here is that this blue-collar sweat, exactly like the waged architect’s flair, can never be directly bought or sold. This is, indeed, the secret power of employers: to extract any surplus, either from highly skilled or from uninspired, repetitive, robotic work, they must pay for their workers’ time (commodity labour) but cannot actually buy their sweat or flair (experiential labour).</p>
<p id="tec0001765">You might think it extremely frustrating to employers that they cannot buy the architect’s <em>eureka</em> moment, the waiter’s spontaneous smile, the teacher’s tear directly, without which their employee’s work produces no value. On the contrary, employers resemble the customer who bought a jacket for a thousand dollars only to find two thousand dollars sewn in its lining. Indeed, if they don’t, they go bust!</p>
<p id="tec0001766">When I first encountered this revelatory explanation of capitalism’s secret, I found it captivating: to think that capitalists owe their profits to an inability, to the impossibility of buying experiential labour directly. And yet, what a boon to <span aria-label="14" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg14" role="doc-pagebreak"/>suffer from such an incapacity! For it is ultimately they who pocket the difference between the exchange value they pay employees in exchange for their <em>commodity</em> labour (wages) and the exchange value of the commodities created thanks to their <em>experiential</em> labour. In other words, labour’s dual nature is what gives rise to profit.</p>
<p id="tec0001767">It is not just labour that has a dual nature. The dominant propaganda today and while I was growing up is that profit is the price, or reward, of a thing called capital, and that people who have capital – such as tools, raw materials, money, anything that can be used to produce saleable goods – make a profit by deploying it, in the same way a worker makes a wage by deploying her labour. But the conclusion that profit results from labour’s contradictory twin natures led me to reject this notion, too. Again, even before I had read Marx, and thanks to paying attention to Mum and Dad, the more I thought of capital the more convinced I became that, like light and labour, it too featured two natures.</p>
<p id="tec0001768">One is commodity capital, e.g. a fishing rod, a tractor, a company’s server, or any good that is produced to be used in the production of other commodities. Capital’s second nature, however, is nothing like a commodity. Suppose I discover that I possess tools you need in order to produce the stuff for your family’s survival, such as the aforementioned fishing rod, tractor, server. Suddenly I have acquired the power to make you do things, for example to work for me, in exchange for the use of my tools. Capital, in short, is both a thing (commodity capital) and a force (power capital) – just as labour is split between commodity labour and experiential labour.</p>
<p id="tec0001769">By the time I began reading Marx, I could not help but filter his words through the lens given to me by my mum’s <span aria-label="15" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg15" role="doc-pagebreak"/>work dysphoria and by my dad’s inspiration from the great twentieth-century physicist. Delighted as I was by the dualities I was seeing, deep down I wondered what Einstein would have made of my wild extrapolations – from his theory of light, or rather from my puny grasp of it, to the essence of capitalism. Had my father inadvertently misrepresented Einstein, prompting my imagination to run away at a tangent thanks to a flimsy and perhaps false metaphor?</p>
<p id="tec0001770">Many years later I chanced upon this sentence written by Einstein himself: ‘It is important to understand that even in theory the payment of the worker is not determined by the value of his product.’ It appeared in an article entitled ‘Why Socialism?’, published in May 1949. Reading it, I breathed a sigh of relief. No, I had not been taking liberties with Einstein’s insights, after all. He too believed that capitalism’s essence was the splitting of labour into two incongruous natures.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0001771"><em>An equally odd introduction to money</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001772">Uncle Albert, as Father used to refer to Einstein on occasion, was not finished with my education regarding capitalism. Having opened my eyes to the dual nature of both labour and capital, he guided me to the dual nature of money through an even more circuitous path involving a certain John Maynard Keynes.</p>
<p id="tec0001773">In 1905, the 26-year-old Einstein found the guts to tell a deeply sceptical world that light was a continuous field of waves made up of particle-like things and, moreover, that energy and matter were, essentially, one ‘thing’ linked by history’s most famous equation: E=mc<sup>2</sup> (i.e. a body’s energy <span aria-label="16" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg16" role="doc-pagebreak"/>content is equal to its mass times the speed of light multiplied by itself). A decade later, Einstein extended this Special Theory of Relativity to elucidate one of the greatest of puzzles: gravity.</p>
<p id="tec0001774">The General Theory of Relativity that resulted was not for the faint-hearted. To grasp it, we first had to embrace a mindset that rejected what our senses told us. If you want to understand gravity, Einstein explained, you need to stop thinking of space as a box that the universe comes in. Matter and energy, operating as one, mould the contours of space and shape the flow of time. The only way to wrap our minds around space and time, or matter and energy, is to think of them as partners locked in the most intimate, insoluble embrace. Gravity is what we feel as we traverse the shortest path through this four-dimensional space-time.</p>
<p id="tec0001775">That our brains find it hard to grasp the reality unveiled by Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity is unsurprising. We evolved on the surface of a planet that is minuscule in comparison to the universe out there. In our limited realm, we can get by quite nicely with our senses’ helpful illusions; for instance, the belief that the grass is green, straight lines exist, or that time is constant and independent of our motion. These beliefs are false and yet helpful to the extent that they enable our architects to design safe buildings and our watches to coordinate our meetings at pre-agreed points in time. When playing pool, as the cue ball strikes a coloured ball, we become convinced of a clear causal effect. But were we to rely on these illusions to travel beyond our planet, to the macrocosm out there, we would be literally lost in space. Equally, when we peer deep into the world of the subatomic particles that comprise our own body, or the chair we are sitting on, even the link between cause and effect vanishes.</p>
<p id="tec0001776"><span aria-label="17" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg17" role="doc-pagebreak"/>What does any of this have to do with money? The title of the most famous economics book of the twentieth century is <em>The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</em>. Published in 1936, it was written by John Maynard Keynes in order to explain why capitalism was failing to recover from the Great Depression, and the allusion to Einstein’s General Theory was intentional. Keynes, who had met Einstein and knew of his work, chose it so as to herald a complete break from conventional economics – a break as clean and decisive as that of Einstein’s from classical physics.</p>
<p id="tec0001777">Of his fellow economists, who insisted that money ought to be understood as another commodity, Keynes once said that they ‘resemble Euclidean geometers in a non-Euclidean world’, again confirming in no uncertain terms Einstein’s influence. Conventional economic thinking about money was damaging humanity, Keynes thought. Economists resembled spacecraft designers disastrously relying on Euclid, not Einstein. They were using illusions which, while helpful in the microcosm of a single market (e.g. the market for potatoes, where a fall in the price can usually be relied upon to boost sales), were catastrophic when applied to the economy at large – the macroeconomy, where a fall in the price of money (the interest rate) may never boost money’s flows in the form of investment and employment.</p>
<p id="tec0001778">In the same way that Einstein had ended our illusion that time stands outside, and apart from, space, Keynes wanted to stop us thinking of money as a thing, as simply another commodity, that stands outside, and apart from, our other activities in markets and workplaces.</p>
<p id="tec0001779">Today, we are bombarded with a phantasmagoria of idiocies about money. Clueless politicians invoke penny-pinching metaphors to justify self-defeating austerity. Central bankers <span aria-label="18" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg18" role="doc-pagebreak"/>facing both inflation and deflation resemble the proverbial ass, both thirsty and hungry, who collapses because it can’t decide whether to drink or to eat first. Crypto enthusiasts invite us to fix the world by embracing the ultimate money-commodity form: Bitcoin and its various offspring. Big Tech is creating its own digital money with which to lure us deeper into its poisonous web of platforms.</p>
<p id="tec0001780">I can think of no better defence in the face of this orchestrated obfuscation than Keynes’s (Einstein-derived) advice: stop thinking about money as something separate from what we do to each other, with each other, at work, during play, in every nook and cranny of our social universe. Yes, money is a thing, a commodity like any other. But it is also something much bigger than that. It is, above all else, a reflection of our relation to one another and to our technologies; i.e. the means and the ways in which we transform matter. Or, as Marx put it poetically:</p>
<blockquote id="tec0001781">
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001782">Money is the alienated ability of mankind. That which I am unable to do as a man, and of which therefore all my individual essential powers are incapable, I am able to do by means of money. Money thus turns each of these powers into something which in itself it is not – turns it, that is, into its contrary.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter001_en_6" id="chapter001_en6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></p>

<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0001783"><em>Free to choose? Or to lose?</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001784">In early 2015, a historical accident made me Greece’s finance minister. Given my mandate to clash with some of the most powerful people and institutions in the world, the international press peered into my articles, books and lectures for <span aria-label="19" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg19" role="doc-pagebreak"/>clues of what to expect. They were baffled by my claim to be a libertarian Marxist – a self-description that was immediately derided by several libertarians and most Marxists. When one of the ruder interviewers asked after the source of my ‘obvious confusion’, I jokingly replied: my parents!</p>
<p id="tec0001785">Joking aside, Father was, at least indirectly, responsible for another crucial component of my political education: my inability to see how one could genuinely cherish freedom and tolerate capitalism (or, vice versa, how one could be both illiberal and left wing). Between them, he and my feminist mother bequeathed me a perspective diagonally opposed to what has become, sadly, conventional fallacy: that capitalism is about freedom, efficiency and democracy, while socialism turns on justice, equality and statism. In fact, from the very start, the left was all about emancipation.</p>
<p id="tec0001786">During the feudal era, which became properly entrenched across Europe in the twelfth century, economic life involved no economic choices. If you were born into the landed gentry, it would never cross your mind to sell your ancestors’ land. And if you were born a serf, you were compelled to toil the land, on the landowner’s behalf, free of any illusion that, one day, you might own land yourself. In short, neither land nor labour power was a commodity. They had no market price. The vast majority of the time, ownership of them changed only through wars of conquest, royal decree or as a result of some catastrophe.</p>
<p id="tec0001787">Then, in the eighteenth century, something remarkable happened. Because of advances in shipping and navigation, international trade in things like wool, linen, silk and spices made them lucrative, thus giving British landlords an idea: why not evict en masse the serfs from land that produced worthless turnips and replace them with sheep whose backs produced <span aria-label="20" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg20" role="doc-pagebreak"/>precious wool for the international markets? The peasants’ eviction, which we now remember as the ‘enclosures’ – for it involved fencing them off from the land their ancestors had toiled for centuries – gave the majority of people something they had lost at the time that agriculture was invented: choice.</p>
<p id="tec0001788">Landlords could choose to lease land for a price reflecting the amount of wool it could produce. The evicted serfs could choose to offer their labour for a wage. Of course, in reality, being free to choose was no different from being free to lose. Former serfs who refused squalid work for a pitiful wage starved to death. Proud aristocrats who refused to go along with the commodification of their land went bankrupt. As feudalism receded, economic choice arrived but was as free as the one offered by a mafioso who, smilingly, tells you: ‘I shall make you an offer you cannot refuse.’</p>
<p id="tec0001789">By the middle of the nineteenth century, the thinking of Marx and other foundational left-wing thinkers was all about <em>freeing</em> us. Specifically, in this era, it was about freeing us from a Dr Frankenstein-like failure to control our creations – not least, the machines of the Industrial Revolution. In the ageless words of <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>:</p>
<blockquote id="tec0001790">
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001791">a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter001_en_7" id="chapter001_en7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent" id="tec0001792">For over a century, the left was concerned primarily with deliverance from self-inflicted unfreedom – which is why it was so fundamentally aligned with the anti-slavery movement, the suffragettes, groups sheltering persecuted Jews in the 1930s and 40s, black liberation organisations in the 1950s <span aria-label="21" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg21" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and 60s, the first gay and lesbian protesters in the streets of San Francisco, Sydney and London in the 1970s. So, how did we get to the situation, today, where ‘libertarian Marxist’ sounds like a joke?</p>
<p id="tec0001793">The answer is that, sometime in the twentieth century, the left traded freedom for other things. In the East (from Russia to China, Cambodia and Vietnam), the quest for emancipation was swapped for a totalitarian egalitarianism. In the West, liberty was left to its enemies, abandoned in exchange for an ill-defined notion of fairness. The moment people believed they had to choose between freedom and fairness, between an iniquitous democracy and miserable state-imposed egalitarianism, it was game over for the left.</p>
<p id="tec0001794">On Boxing Day in 1991, I was visiting Athens to spend a few days with my parents. As we chatted over dinner in front of that same red-brick fireplace, the red flag was being lowered above the Kremlin. Thanks to Dad’s communist past and Mum’s social democratic leanings, they shared a common mood. They knew that, on that very night, history was marking not just the demise of the Soviet Union but also the end of the social democratic dream: of a mixed economy, in which government provided public goods while the private sector produced plentiful goodies to satisfy our whims – all in all, a civilised form of capitalism where inequality and exploitation were kept in check in the context of a politically mediated truce between the owners of capital and those who had nothing to sell but their labour.</p>
<p id="tec0001795">Circumspect, though not glum, the three of us agreed we were witnessing a defeat made inevitable once our side had lost the conviction that capitalism was iniquitous because it was inefficient, that it was unjust because it was illiberal, that it was chaotic because it was irrational. Falling back to basics, <span aria-label="22" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg22" role="doc-pagebreak"/>I asked Mum and Dad what freedom meant to them. Mother replied: the ability to choose your partners and your projects. Father’s reply was similar: time to read, to experiment and to write. Whatever <em>your</em> definition might be, dear reader, being free to lose in a variety of soul-crushing ways can’t be it.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0001796"><em>Father’s question</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001797">Almost everyone today takes to capitalism as fish take to water – without even noticing it is there, treating it as the invisible, irreplaceable, natural ether we move through. As Fredric Jameson famously put it, people find it easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. For my father’s generation of leftists, however, there was a brief moment in the mid to late 1940s when the end of capitalism seemed only a matter of a few years if not months away. But then one thing led to another and capitalism’s demise shifted further and further into the future until, after 1991, it disappeared beyond the horizon.</p>
<p id="tec0001798">Being of the generation who had believed that capitalism was transitory, Dad continued to contemplate capitalism’s expiry even after he had concluded he would not live to see it. Nevertheless, a decade or so after our fireside experiments, with the dream of socialism in deep recession, and while I dived into the works of the political economists, Father increasingly immersed himself in the study of ancient technology.</p>
<p id="tec0001799">Every now and then, feeling he could guiltlessly leave to me the exploration of capitalism’s mysteries while he relished the unalloyed joys of archaeometry, he would speculate on how capitalism might, one day, end – and what would <span aria-label="23" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg23" role="doc-pagebreak"/>replace it. His wish was that it would not die with a bang, because bangs had a tendency to cull good people in awful numbers; that instead socialist islands might spring up spontaneously in our vast capitalist archipelago and that they would expand gradually, eventually forming whole continents on which technologically advanced commons would prevail.</p>
<p id="tec0001800">In 1987, he sought my help to set up his first desktop computer. A glorified typewriter, he called it, but with an impressive on-screen editing facility. ‘Imagine how many more volumes Marx’s complete works would consist of if the bearded one had owned one of these,’ he joked. As if to prove the point, he used it over the years that followed to churn out voluminous papers and books on the interplay between the ancient Greeks’ technology and literature.</p>
<p id="tec0001801">Six years on, in 1993, I arrived at the Paleo Phaliro home with a clunky early modem to connect his computer to the fledgling internet. ‘This is a game changer,’ he said. Struggling to dial up a woefully slow Greek internet provider, he asked me the killer question that ultimately inspired this book: ‘Now that computers speak to each other, will this network make capitalism impossible to overthrow? Or might it finally reveal its Achilles heel?’</p>
<p id="tec0001802">Caught up in my own projects and dramas, I never got round to answering Father’s question. When I finally decided I had an answer for him, Dad was already ninety-five and finding it hard to follow my musings. And so, here I am, a few years later, only a few weeks after his passing, composing my answer – belatedly, but I hope not in vain.</p>
