<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000628">It all began with an old, harmless idea. For decades, farmers were insuring themselves against falling prices by buying the right (or option) to sell next year’s harvest at a pre-agreed, fixed price. It was nothing more than an insurance contract: the wheat farmer paid a premium to insure against a catastrophic drop in the price of wheat.</p>
<p id="tec0000629">The first mutation of this idea into something more sinister was when the ‘thing’ that was being insured stopped being a thing (like wheat) and became a bet, a wager, a gamble. Consider Jack who is about to buy shares worth $1 million. Like the farmer who buys insurance to protect himself against a drastic fall in the price of wheat, Jack could buy from Jill a <em>get-me-out-of-here</em> option to sell his shares to Jill at, say, $800,000 (i.e. he limits his potential loss to $200,000). Like any form of insurance, if disaster does <em>not</em> strike (i.e. the shares’ price does not fall more than 20 per cent, to below $800,000), Jack’s insurance policy (or option) will pay him nothing. But if, say, Jack’s shares shed 40 per cent of their value, Jack is covered for half of that loss. Not great but not terrible either.</p>
<p id="tec0000630">These options (or derivatives) had been available under Bretton Woods. To mutate into something truly dangerous, though, Bretton Woods had to die first. Its death meant that bankers, liberated from their New Deal chains, were allowed to bet on the stock exchange first with other people’s money and, later, with money they conjured up from thin air. Soon, Wall Street was going gangbusters, especially after 1982. Without even knowing why, finance’s golden boys and girls began to see themselves as the invincible masters and mistresses of the universe. Under the <span aria-label="238" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg238" role="doc-pagebreak"/>influence of that feeling, they had an idea: instead of purchasing an <em>option to sell</em> shares (as an insurance in case the shares they were buying dropped in value), why not buy an <em>option to buy</em> even more shares? Sounds crazy? Perhaps. But the madness went unnoticed in the cacophony of all the money-making it enabled.</p>
<p id="tec0000631">Here is what Jack would do: on top of spending $1 million on, say, a bundle of Microsoft shares, he would pay Jill another $100,000 for a guarantee that, in a year’s time, she will sell him another such bundle of Microsoft shares for the same total price he paid today ($1 million). In their language, Jack would buy from Jill an <em>option to buy</em> more Microsoft shares in a year’s time but at today’s price. Why do that? Because if during the next twelve months Microsoft’s shares were to rise by, say, 40 per cent, Jack would receive two gains: the $400,000 gain from the appreciation of the bundle of Microsoft shares he actually bought, plus another $400,000 from the <em>option to buy</em> a second such bundle of Microsoft shares at last year’s lower price – an option that he can now sell to others for $400,000 without even having to buy that second bundle of shares himself. Jack’s total net gain, considering he paid Jill $100,000 for the option, would come to $700,000: a much better return (64 per cent) to his $1.1 million expenditure than the return (40 per cent) from only buying $1 million of Microsoft shares.</p>
<p id="tec0000632">In a Wall Street where the bulls dominated the bears for many consecutive years, and everything was going up, up and away, a contagion of unchecked greed (captured so well on celluloid by Oliver Stone’s <em>Wall Street</em>) led the Jills and the Jacks to an even more radical idea: why buy shares at all? Why not buy only options? Here was their thinking: if Jack spent his $1.1 million only on <em>options to buy</em> Microsoft shares next year at today’s share price, and the share price were to increase by 40 per cent, his net gain would be a stunning $3.3 million – an exorbitant 300 per cent rate of return! Jack, seeing this, decided to go all in: to borrow as <span aria-label="239" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg239" role="doc-pagebreak"/>many millions as he could to buy such options from Jill. Jill, seeing how much Jack made from the <em>options to buy</em> she had sold him, decided to copy him. Using the money she received from Jack, and a whole lot more that she borrowed, she bought similar <em>options to buy</em> from other traders.</p>
<p id="tec0000633">You may well ask: were there no smart people in Wall Street to sound the alarm bells? Of course there were. But their warnings were drowned out. Month after month the Jills and the Jacks raked in gargantuan profits. Traders who spoke out against them were shunned as moaning losers. Managers who hardly understood the complexity of the derivatives that overfilled their coffers with money felt compelled to silence dissent. The dissenters had a choice: quit, which some did, or join in this <em>leverage</em> racket – a techno-euphemism for huge debt fuelling ridiculous bets. As long as the going was good, it was as if they had discovered an ATM in their living room which kept churning out unlimited cash without charging it to any bank account. All they had to do was borrow as if there were no tomorrow. Unsurprisingly, by 2007, ten times more money than humanity’s total income had been placed on the roulette of, mostly, Wall Street and the City of London.</p>
<p id="tec0000634">In this new Gilded Age that Nixon’s Shock occasioned, the technostructure faced stiff competition for the best and brightest minds. Physics PhDs from the best schools, dazzling mathematicians, even artists and historians were flocking to Wall Street. Power was shifting fast from the Fords, the Hiltons and the Drapers to Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns and Lehman’s. To catch up, large parts of the technostructure adapted by joining in. When auditors entered the bankrupted General Motors in 2009, after this financialisation bubble had burst, they discovered that a company famed for producing cars and trucks had been transformed into a hedge fund buying and selling options – with some car production on the side to keep up appearances.</p>
