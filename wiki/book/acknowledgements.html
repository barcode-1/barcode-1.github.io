<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000636">One influence that led me to technofeudalism – the word – came from John Kenneth Galbraith’s 1967 book <em>The New Industrial State</em> (Princeton University Press). In it, Galbraith coined the term technostructure to denote the de facto merger of US government departments and corporations whose interchangeable band of professional managers, marketers, analysts, financiers and engineers stood out as a class quite distinct from capitalists and workers. While Galbraith’s technostructure never threatened to undermine capitalism (indeed, it did the opposite – see <a href="chapter002.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>), there are clear trajectories leading from it to our technofeudal order half a century later (see <a href="chapter003.xhtml">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="chapter004.xhtml">4</a>).</p>
<p id="tec0000637">By 2018, I was already testing the waters with my technofeudal hypothesis in various papers and talks. Meanwhile, the debates on the impact of Big Tech were reinforced by the notion of surveillance capitalism made popular by Shoshana Zuboff’s book <em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future and the New Frontier of Power</em> (Public Affairs). Two years later, Cédric Durand added to the excitement with his <em>Technoféodalisme: Critique de l’Économie Numérique</em> (Zones).</p>
<p id="tec0000638">Both Zuboff and Durand treat Big Tech as monopoly capitalists whose digital platforms (e.g. Facebook, Amazon) function like utilities (e.g. electricity providers, water and sewage corporations, railway networks or phone companies), except that Big Tech use the cloud to harvest our data so as to boost their monopoly power over us. While sympathetic to their thesis, I was convinced that a lot more was going on than Silicon Valley <span aria-label="241" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg241" role="doc-pagebreak"/>capitalists merely boosting their market power over us by means of cloud-based surveillance.</p>
<p id="tec0000639">One book from which I drew much courage that I was not wrong to believe that something more fundamental was in play, and that capitalism itself was in question, is McKenzie Wark’s 2019 exquisite <em>Capital Is Dead: Is This Something Worse?</em> (Verso). I cannot recommend it too strongly. Many of my ideas resonated loudly with hers, except perhaps one: Wark writes of a new ‘vectoralist’ class in control of a vector that connects a supplier of materials to all stages of production and distribution in a manner that undermines, and usurps, capital. That’s not how I saw it. What she refers to as a vector choking capital seemed to me a new mutation of capital – a cloud capital so virulent that it created a new ruling class with feudal-like powers to extract wealth.</p>
<p id="tec0000640">Readers who know me even a little will not be surprised by the <em>Star Trek</em> reference I am about to make. Believe it or not, my term cloud capital harks back to the twenty-first episode of the third season (originally screened on 28 February 1969) of the original series entitled ‘The Cloud Minders’. Written by Margaret Armen (based on a story by David Gerrold and Oliver Crawford), the episode unfolds on Ardana, a planet where a ruling class lives luxuriously in Stratos – a city floating motionlessly atop the planet’s clouds. Meanwhile all labour is performed on the ground, and in underground tunnels, by the Troglytes whose minds are continually poisoned by a noxious gas which placates and stupefies them. The temptation to make the leap from <em>Star Trek</em>’s cloud minders to technofeudalism’s cloud capital proved impossible to resist. Then, in 2022, I felt vindicated when Brett Scott published his excellent neo-Luddite book, railing against plastic and digital money, entitled <em>Cloudmoney:</em> <em>Cash, Cards, Crypto and the War for our Wallets</em> (The Bodley Head).</p>
<p id="tec0000641">Besides McKenzie Wark, Cory Doctorow is another author <span aria-label="242" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg242" role="doc-pagebreak"/>whose arguments and ideas are closest to mine. I highly recommend anything he has written on his blog and in various magazines (e.g. <em>Wired</em>) plus, of course, the 2022 book he co-authored with Rebecca Giblin entitled <em>Chokepoint Capitalism: How Big Tech and Big Content Captured Creative Labor Markets and How We’ll Win Them Back</em> (Beacon Press).</p>
<p id="tec0000642">Last but not least I must thank my editor Will Hammond, with whom working is such an unalloyed joy, and Judith Meyer, a friend and comrade to whom I owe much of the little I know about modern algorithms, coding, cloud tech et al.</p>
