<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001804">Dad, it <em>was</em> capitalism’s Achilles heel, after all: the digitally networked technologies that capitalism spawned proved its comeuppance. The result? Humanity is now being taken over by something that I can only describe as a technologically advanced form of feudalism. A technofeudalism that is certainly not what we had hoped would supersede capitalism.</p>
<p id="tec0001805">I can tell you are puzzled, Dad. Wherever we look today, capital is triumphant. New monuments to its power spring up everywhere – physical ones in our cities and across our landscapes, digital ones on our screens and in our hands. Meanwhile, the capital-poor sink deeper into precarity and our democracies bend their knee to capital’s will. So, how dare I even imagine that capitalism is on the way out; that it is being taken over? Have I forgotten that nothing strengthens capitalism more than the illusion it is evolving out of existence and into something new – a mixed economy, a welfare state, a global village?</p>
<p id="tec0001806">No, of course I have not forgotten. Metamorphosis is to capitalism what camouflage is to a chameleon: essence and defence mechanism combined. And yet, we are not talking about mere disguises. Several of capitalism’s transformations have been epoch changing. One of those was unfolding at around the time you were educating me to iron’s magic in front of our fireplace. And in fact, to explain what I mean by technofeudalism, I need first to describe in some detail this transformation – capitalism’s latest series of metamorphoses, <span aria-label="25" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg25" role="doc-pagebreak"/>which is the subject of this chapter. Only then, in the next chapter, will I be able to begin to explain properly what has replaced it.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0001807"><em>Retrieving the irretrievable</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001808">In an episode of <em>Mad Men</em>, the television series on the rise of advertising in the 1960s, the legendary creative director Don Draper coaches his protégée, Peggy, on how to think of Hershey, a chocolate bar that their firm is peddling. Draper’s marketing philosophy perfectly encapsulates the spirit of the times: ‘You are the product. You, feeling something.’ Or, as James Poniewozik interprets Draper’s line in <em>Time</em> magazine: ‘You don’t buy a Hershey bar for a couple of ounces of chocolate. You buy it to recapture the feeling of being loved that you knew when your dad bought you one for mowing the lawn.’<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter002_en_1" id="chapter002_en1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></p>
<p id="tec0001809">The mass commercialisation of nostalgia Draper alludes to marked a turning point for capitalism. While the big issues of the 1960s were the Vietnam War, civil rights and the institutions that might civilise capitalism (Medicare, food stamps, the welfare state), Draper was putting his finger on a fundamental mutation in its DNA. Efficiently manufacturing things that people craved was no longer enough. Capitalism now involved the skilful manufacture of desire.</p>
<p id="tec0001810">Capitalism had begun as a relentless drive to put a price on things that once had no price: common lands, human labour, all the stuff that families once produced for their own consumption – from bread and home-brewed wine to woolly jumpers and various tools. If there was something that humans shared and enjoyed but which had no price and <span aria-label="26" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg26" role="doc-pagebreak"/>mattered to us only for its intrinsic or ‘experiential value’ – like granny’s handcrafted tablecloth, or a beautiful sunset, or a beguiling song – capitalism found a way to commodify it: to subjugate its experiential value to an exchange value.</p>
<p id="tec0001811">It was in the nature of the beast. Capitalism is synonymous with the triumph of exchange value because it is the only value that can be crystallised into more capital. Just as the Borg in <em>Star Trek</em> depend on assimilating the biological and technological distinctiveness of other species for their survival, capitalism has taken over planet Earth by assimilating wherever possible any experiential value it encounters into its exchange value chain. Having assimilated every resource, crop and artefact it could, capitalism has since gone on to commodify the airwaves, women’s wombs, art, genotypes, asteroids, even space itself. In the process, the experiential value of all things is reduced to a dollar sum, a commercial asset, a tradable contract.</p>
<p id="tec0001812">And yet, contrary to the Borg’s scary greeting – ‘You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile!’ – experiential value’s resistance has not been in vain. Each time the onslaught of exchange value has overcome its defences, experiential value has gone underground into the catacombs of our psyche. It is there that Don Draper – or, more accurately, the men and women <em>Mad Men</em> is based on – discovered it, retrieved it and, yes, commodified it. In the process, capitalism changed radically.</p>
<p id="tec0001813">Watching <em>Mad Men</em>, the audience wonder why the firm pays Draper a mint to do what he does. Mostly horizontal on a comfortable couch in his office, he consumes impressive quantities of bourbon, has a series of breakdowns, behaves erratically and unprofessionally, and when he does deign to share what he’s thinking, usually offers only cryptic and <span aria-label="27" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg27" role="doc-pagebreak"/>disjointed thoughts. But just when you expect him to self-destruct or get fired, he comes up with magical ways of reimagining anything from mediocre chocolate and humdrum steel products to second-rate hamburger restaurant chains in ways that make them emotionally resonant and intensely desirable. In both aspects of his behaviour, Draper captures the essence of capitalism’s post-war transformation: the discovery of a new market, namely the market for our attention, grafted onto a shiny new industrial structure, but all within a system that remains fully reliant on labour’s dual nature.</p>
<p id="tec0001814">For the dual nature of Draper’s labour is writ large in every episode of <em>Mad Men</em>. His bosses would love to be able to purchase his ideas without having to tolerate him lounging around the office half drunk. In the language of the previous chapter, they would jump at the opportunity to buy Draper’s experiential labour directly. Only they couldn’t, even if he wanted to sell it to them. Instead, they are forced to buy his commodity labour (i.e. his time and potential) in the hope that, during his inebriated daze, his genius will spontaneously deliver the famed Draper magic. And when it does, their immense profits confirm once again that capital is born out of the capitalists’ inability to buy experiential labour directly.</p>
<p id="tec0001815">Draper’s genius, meanwhile, is to grasp, and to confront, the paradox of commodification. Yes, capitalism must commodify everything it touches. But at the same time, high exchange value, and thus serious profits, depends on failing to do so fully. If it is to avoid the fate of a school of predators that devours its prey so efficiently that it starves to death, capitalism relies on there being an endless supply of experiential values for its exchange values to trounce and cannibalise. <span aria-label="28" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg28" role="doc-pagebreak"/>It must always be discovering and commodifying what has so far escaped it.</p>
<p id="tec0001816">Smart advertisers do exactly that: they tap into emotions that have previously escaped commodification in order to capture our attention. And then they sell our attention to an entity whose business is to commodify whatever experiential value was hiding in our soul, fleeing commodification. With his Hershey bar speech, Draper lays bare a crucial aspect of how, soon after the war, capitalism reached its golden age. How could the profits keep flowing once everything has seemingly been commodified already? Draper’s answer: through the triggering of uncommodified emotions deep inside us.</p>
<p id="tec0001817">Thus a Hershey bar becomes the simulacrum of a dead father’s caress. Bethlehem Steel is rebranded as the spirit of the American <em>polis</em>, with the steel product symbolising the New World’s own Iron Age. When Draper and Peggy visit a Burger Chef outlet, they discern the possibility of a television advertisement that promotes the chain as an opportunity for families to be reunited around its plastic tables – away from the family home where togetherness is no longer possible because everyone’s attention has been arrested by … the television.</p>
<p id="tec0001818">So what did capitalism look like before this great transformation occurred? And how did this transformation take place?</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0001819"><em>Technostructure</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001820">Another way to ask the same question would be: where did Sterling Cooper &amp; Partners (Draper’s fictional firm) find the <span aria-label="29" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg29" role="doc-pagebreak"/>money or willingness to treat him like an academic? To pay him good money to think deeply at a pace of his choosing? Capitalism’s early advocates would have been perplexed. Their idea of entrepreneurship took the form of parsimonious bakers, butchers and brewers eagerly striving to satisfy their customers’ basic needs by working hard, thinking on their feet, economising on everything, squeezing the last drop of exchange value out of any raw materials they could lay their hands on. What changed that meant a character like Draper could become an icon of our enterprise culture? I think you will like my answer, Dad: electromagnetism!</p>
<p id="tec0001821">Once James Clerk Maxwell had written down the equations linking electrical current to magnetic force, it was only a matter of time before someone like Thomas Edison would turn them into the electricity and telegraph grids that ultimately begat the networked, top-down, mega-corporations we know today – pushing the bakers, butchers and brewers of early capitalism to the sidelines. The problem was that none of capitalism’s early institutions – specifically, its banks and share markets – were ready for such corporate empires. Simply put, the banks were too small and too fragile and the share markets too thin, too illiquid, to provide the kind of funds Edison needed to build his famous Pearl Street power station, let alone the rest of his electricity grid.</p>
<p id="tec0001822">To produce the rivers of credit necessary to fund the Edisons, the Westinghouses and the Fords of early-twentieth-century capitalism, small banks merged to form large ones and lent either to the industrialists directly or to speculators eager to buy shares in the new corporations. That’s how electromagnetism transformed capitalism: while its grids would go on to power mega-firms and its megawatts translated into mega-profits, it also created the first mega-debts in the form <span aria-label="30" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg30" role="doc-pagebreak"/>of vast overdraft facilities for the Edisons, the Westinghouses and the Fords. And it led to the emergence of Big Finance, which grew up alongside Big Business in order to lend it monies borrowed effectively from the future: from profits not yet realised but which Big Business promised to deliver. These wagers on future profits funded not only the construction of Big Business’s grids and production lines but an almighty froth of speculation as well.</p>
<p id="tec0001823">Parsimony was out and largesse became the new virtue. The Victorian belief that firms should be small and powerless, so that competition could perform its magic of keeping entrepreneurs honest, was replaced by the creed that ‘what is good for Big Business is good for America’. The Jazz Age swept restraint away, debt’s dirty name was cleansed in the torrents of anticipated profits, caution was thrown to the winds of credit.</p>
<p id="tec0001824">Within a decade, electromagnetism had sparked the Roaring Twenties whose inevitable heart-wrenching crash came in 1929, the year the grapes of wrath began to fill and grow heavy for the vintage. Whether one believes that Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal ended the Great Depression, or that it was the war that did it, one thing is clear: the New Deal also changed global capitalism profoundly. The New Deal’s public works projects, its social welfare programmes and, above all, its public finance instruments, together with stringent controls over what bankers could get away with, constituted a full-on dress rehearsal for the War Economy.</p>
<p id="tec0001825">For immediately after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor brought the US into the Second World War, the US government began to emulate … the Soviet one. It told factory owners how much to produce and to what specifications, from aircraft carriers to processed food. It even employed a <span aria-label="31" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg31" role="doc-pagebreak"/>price czar – the economist John Kenneth Galbraith – whose job, literally, was to decide the price of everything, to fend off inflation, and to ensure a smooth economic transition from wartime to peacetime. It is no exaggeration to say that American capitalism was run according to Soviet planning principles, with the important exception that the networked factories remained under the private ownership of Big Business.</p>
<p id="tec0001826">Under President Roosevelt, the US government’s deal with Big Business was simple: they would produce what was necessary to win the war and, in exchange, the state would reward them with four incredible gifts. First, state guaranteed sales translating into state guaranteed profits. Second, freedom from competition, since prices were fixed by government. Third, huge government-funded scientific research (e.g. the Manhattan Project, jet propulsion) that provided Big Business with wonderful new innovations and a pool of highly skilled scientific personnel to recruit from during and after the war. And fourth, a patriotic aura to help rinse off the stench of corporate greed that clung to them after the crash of 1929 and make them over as heroic enterprises that helped America win the war.</p>
<p id="tec0001827">The War Economy experiment was an unqualified success. Production quadrupled in less than five years. Inflation was kept on a leash, unlike what had happened during the previous world war. Unemployment disappeared, and was kept at bay even after the soldiers, sailors and airmen returned from the front. To Big Business, it was a dream come true that compensated them handsomely for the subjugation of Big Finance to the government’s plans and strictures.</p>
<p id="tec0001828">Beneath the surface, however, the heat of war had transformed American capitalism at a molecular level, just as the <span aria-label="32" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg32" role="doc-pagebreak"/>heat of our fireplace had transformed iron into steel. By the war’s end, American capitalism was unrecognisable. Business and government had become profoundly entwined. Indeed, the revolving doors between government departments and corporations saw to it that the same crowd of mathematicians, scientists, analysts and professional managers populated them both. The heroic entrepreneur at the helm of the corporation and the democratically elected politician at the head of the government had both been usurped by this new private-public decision-making network, whose values and priorities – indeed its survival – boiled down to one thing: the survival and growth of the conglomerates now that the war, with its infinite demand for stuff and technologies, was over. Galbraith called this nexus the technostructure.</p>
<p id="tec0001829">Profitability remained essential for the army of technicians and influence-wielding employees making up the technostructure. Nevertheless, profit was no longer their top priority. As with all bureaucracies, their primary goal was to keep their underlings employed and busy. This meant they had not merely to avoid the shrinking of their conglomerates at the war’s end, but to grow them. With the war behind them, one question kept the good folks of the technostructure up at night: if the government would no longer guarantee sales and prices, where would they find enough customers ready and willing to pay for all the chocolate bars, cars and washing machines that they were planning to manufacture using the capacity hitherto dedicated to producing bullets, machine guns and flame-throwers?</p>
<p id="tec0001830">The New Dealers in government took it upon themselves to help the technostructure secure foreign customers – which as we shall see triggered another of the great metamorphoses of twentieth-century capitalism. But as for domestic <span aria-label="33" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg33" role="doc-pagebreak"/>customers, that’s where Don Draper came in. His stock-in-trade? Opening the technostructure’s eyes to the boundless possibilities of founding a new market for our attention on a bed of raw emotion. The technostructure had the manufacture of things fully under its control. With Draper’s help, it could now look forward to manufacturing the necessary desire for them. Paying Draper a large salary to lounge around for most of the working day was a small price to pay for such an extraordinary power.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0001831"><em>Attention markets and the Soviets’ revenge</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001832">On a cold January day in 1903, in front of a large audience at Coney Island’s Luna Park, Thomas Edison used alternating current to electrocute to death Topsy, a helpless elephant. His purpose? To draw the public’s attention to the deadliness of the type of electricity peddled by George Westinghouse, his competitor. Despite the novel awfulness, nothing significantly new had happened: a powerful man had used the age-old trick of grabbing the public’s attention to sell himself and his offerings.</p>
<p id="tec0001833">From a peacock’s feathers to a Roman emperor’s triumphal march to the fashion industry of today, competing for others’ attention is about as old as sexual reproduction. But it wasn’t until the twentieth century that the process of attention-grabbing was commodified. Once again, it was electromagnetism that achieved this revolutionary feat – not by killing an elephant but by allowing for the invention of the radio and, even more importantly, the television set.</p>
<p id="tec0001834">At first, radio and television gave Big Business a headache. It offered them immense opportunities to engage and <span aria-label="34" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg34" role="doc-pagebreak"/>persuade the masses, but fundamentally its output – the programmes it broadcast – had the properties of a sunset rather than a tin of beans: however much you loved watching <em>I Love Lucy</em> on television, and even if you were <em>prepared</em> to pay good money to watch it, no one had the capacity to <em>make</em> you pay for it (at least not before cable TV was introduced). But this stopped being a problem once they realised that the programme was not the commodity: it was the attention of the people watching it. By broadcasting the programme for free, they could secure the audience’s attention allowing them then to sell it – in the form of advertisement breaks – to Draper’s clients, who were now so eager to instil new desires in the hearts of the American public.</p>
<p id="tec0001835">With the birth of commercial television, the technostructure appended a boisterous attention market to its labour market. The dual nature of labour was now coupled with the dual nature of the spectacle: on the one hand, a cultural product with large experiential value but no exchange value, and on the other the captured attention of viewers with substantial exchange value but no experiential value.</p>
<p id="tec0001836">The cultural impact was enormous. But the less visible impact was no less momentous. A new group of experts had been grafted onto the technostructure: alongside the scientists, analysts and professional managers, there were now creative types like Draper, as well as a whole raft of strategists and engineers working on new ways to manipulate and commodify our attention.</p>
<p id="tec0001837">It was another historic transformation. By the early 1960s, the commodities that made real money were no longer the ones that prevailed in some Darwinian struggle for existence within some competitive market. No, the products that <span aria-label="35" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg35" role="doc-pagebreak"/>adorned every home were the ones that the Drapers and the executives of the conglomerates fashioned together in meetings at the technostructure’s skyscraper offices. There, over lots of smoking and drinking, they jointly decided the prices, the quantities, the packages and even the feelings imparted by capitalism’s leading products. Whereas capitalism had come to life by turning feudalism’s societies-with-markets into decentralised market societies, the rise of the technostructure transformed American capitalism from a decentralised market society into a centralised economy-with-markets. It was precisely what the Soviet planners had always hoped to achieve, but failed.</p>
<p id="tec0001838">And there’s the irony. In the 1960s, a decade marked by an ideological and nuclear clash between America and the Soviet Union that almost blew up the world, Soviet planning principles were implemented with remarkable success in … the United States. Irony has seldom taken a more effective revenge over earnest ideology.</p>
<p id="tec0001839">That was as far as the technostructure’s domestic customers went – those within the USA. What about the rest of the world? It was all very well converting America’s factories from manufacturing tanks, ammunition, fighter planes and aircraft carriers to churning out washing machines, cars, television sets and passenger jets. The problem was that America’s industrial capacity had grown so much during the war that, to keep its factories busy and its workers in jobs, they had to produce a lot more stuff than Americans alone could absorb. Drilling new desires into the American consumer could never be enough because there were not enough American middle-class homes to do the necessary consuming. Foreign markets had to be found.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0001840"><em><span aria-label="36" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg36" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The audacious Global Plan</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001841">I remember one evening in 1975 you came home with ‘extraordinary’ news: thirty drachmas were no longer enough to buy us one American dollar, you announced. Not that it made any difference to us, since we had neither the means nor the legal right to buy more than a handful of dollars. But you were anxious that an exchange rate that had stood still since 1957 had just broken down. What did that mean for our future as a family and for our small country where the shockwaves caused by grand ruptures originating in America usually took a while to hit? Thinking back, your hunch was exactly right: this was indeed a local reverberation of something that originated in the US and that augured a violent and this time global metamorphosis of capitalism.</p>
<p id="tec0001842">The breakdown of the drachma–dollar exchange rate that had so impressed you was a consequence of the downfall four years earlier, in August 1971, of the so-called Bretton Woods system. (As with the 2008 financial crisis, which took two long years to flatten Greece, the collapse of Bretton Woods also took some time to hit us. A German friend once quipped: ‘If I hear that the end of the world is nigh, I shall immediately move to Greece – everything takes a couple of years longer over there.’) Bretton Woods<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter002_en_2" id="chapter002_en2" role="doc-noteref">2</a> was the audacious global financial system devised by the New Dealers in 1944, whose purpose was noble: to thwart the Great Depression’s return after the war had ended. Its strategy, however, was perhaps less so: it aimed to append post-war Europe and Japan to America’s gleaming new War Economy.</p>
<p id="tec0001843">The New Dealers knew that once the German armies had <span aria-label="37" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg37" role="doc-pagebreak"/>been defeated, Europe would lie in ruins, its peoples penniless. So Washington understood that its first task would be to remonetise Europe – literally, to provide them with money to spend in order to get their economies running again. That was easier said than done. With Europe’s gold either spent or stolen, its factories and infrastructure turned to rubble, hordes of refugees roaming its highways and byways, the concentration camps still reeking with the stench of humanity’s unspeakable cruelty, Europe needed much more than freshly minted paper money. Something had to instil the new notes with value. After all, what gives any currency value but the economy that stands behind it?</p>
<p id="tec0001844">Only one thing could circumvent the problem: the dollar! The financial project of the Bretton Woods system was bold: to ‘dollarise’ the currencies of Europe and Japan by linking European currencies and the yen to the dollar with fixed exchange rates – hence the thirty drachmas to one dollar whose demise disturbed you in 1975. In essence, it was a global currency union based on the US dollar. With the mighty US economy standing behind them, the currencies would retain a significant and stable value.</p>
<p id="tec0001845">Naturally, there had to be limits to how many dollars one could get for one’s ‘funny money’ – Greek drachmas, Italian lire, etc. These limits were known as capital controls: restrictions in the movement of money from one currency to another. They made the life of bankers wonderfully boring by denying them the opportunity to speculate on shifts in the relative value of currencies, which they would otherwise have done by shifting large quantities of money from one currency to another, from one country to another. That was, of course, intentional. Having been burned by the 1929 catastrophe, the New Dealers wanted bankers to live in a <span aria-label="38" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg38" role="doc-pagebreak"/>straitjacket of capital controls and almost fixed interest rates, with only tiny wiggle room of 1 per cent here or there.</p>
<p id="tec0001846">Alongside this bold financial project was a political one. In the East, the New Dealers rewrote the Japanese constitution and oversaw its transformation into a technostructure-with-Japanese-characteristics. In Europe, they guided the foundation of the European Union as a cartel of heavy industry centred upon German manufacturing, adapting their technostructure blueprint to European circumstances. To make this happen, they had to rewrite the German constitution and, with promises of handing administrative and political oversight over to Paris, thwart the French ambition to de-industrialise Germany.</p>
<p id="tec0001847">This dazzling design, America’s Global Plan to remake Europe and Japan in the imagine of its technostructure, led to capitalism’s Golden Age. From the war’s end until 1971, America, Europe and Japan enjoyed low unemployment, low inflation, high growth and massively diminished inequality. The New Dealers’ job was almost done. And it was done in a way that even the staunchest Republican moguls appreciated. Turning to <em>Mad Men</em> for one more symbolic insight, there is a scene where Conrad Hilton, the hotel mogul, shares with Don Draper his true ambition, which encapsulates the spirit of this Global Plan: ‘It’s my purpose in life to bring America to the world whether they like it or not. You know, we are a force of good, Don, because we have God.’</p>
<p id="tec0001848">Whether the scriptwriter meant God as a stand-in for the dollar or not, it is fair to say that American hegemony in this era relied on the almighty power of its currency: the only currency everyone wanted even if they never cared to buy anything coming from America.</p>
<p id="tec0001849">But all this relied on one crucial factor. For the dollar to be <span aria-label="39" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg39" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the apple of everyone’s eye, at the fixed exchange rates the Bretton Woods system guaranteed, America had to be a surplus-amassing country – meaning, it had to sell more goods and services to the rest of the world than it imported. Of course, selling goods to the Europeans and Japanese was more than just a bonus outcome: it was how the technostructure would secure for itself the vast new markets it needed to sustain its industries and keep its economy growing. But the whole system also relied on this surplus integrally, for it was what ensured that the dollars printed by the Federal Reserve (America’s central bank) and given to the Europeans and to the Japanese (either as loans or aid) would ultimately find their way back to the United States in return for US goods. With every Boeing jet or General Electric washing machine sold to the Europeans, a bundle of dollars would head home back across the Atlantic. And as long as migratory dollars were gravitating back home, the dollar would remain a steal at the given exchange rate, guaranteeing that the Germans, the British, the French, the Japanese, even the Greeks wanted to get many more dollars for their funny money than the authorities allowed them at the official exchange rate.</p>
<p id="tec0001850">As long as America was the major surplus nation, Bretton Woods was safe as houses. And that’s why, by the late 1960s, the Bretton Woods system was dead in the water. The reason? Three developments which caused America to lose its trade surplus and become a chronically deficit economy. The first was the escalating Vietnam War which forced the US government to spend billions in South East Asia on supplies and services for its military. The second was President Lyndon Johnson’s attempt to make amends for the ill effects of conscription on working-class America, its black communities in particular. His valiant but expensive Great Society programme <span aria-label="40" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg40" role="doc-pagebreak"/>substantially reduced poverty but, at once, sucked lots of imported goods from Japan and Europe into the United States. Lastly, Japan’s and Germany’s factories surpassed America’s both in terms of quality and efficiency, partly due to the support successive US governments had extended to Japan’s and Germany’s manufacturing sectors – the car industry being an obvious example.</p>
<p id="tec0001851">Never too slow to accept reality, Washington killed off its finest creation: on 15 August 1971 President Nixon announced the ejection of Europe and Japan from the dollar zone. Bretton Woods was dead.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter002_en_3" id="chapter002_en3" role="doc-noteref">3</a> The door had been opened to a new and truly dismal phase in capitalism’s evolution.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0001852"><em>Mad numbers</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001853">In 2002, thirty years after the Nixon Shock, humanity’s total income approximated $50 trillion. In the same year, financiers around the world had wagered $70 trillion on a variety of bets. I remember your eyes popping out when you heard this outrageous number. Like most people, you refused to wrap your mind around it. Used to thinking of money in terms of things that made sense, like tons of steel or the number of hospitals it could build, you could not see how Earth was large enough to contain that $70 trillion number.</p>
<p id="tec0001854">By 2007, humanity’s total income had risen from $50 to $75 trillion – a decent 33 per cent increase over five years. But the sum of bets in the global money market had gone up from $70 to $750 trillion – a rise in excess of 1000 per cent. That’s when I lost you. Or, more accurately, it is when we agreed that the numbers had gone mad, an arithmetic reflection of capitalism’s hubris.</p>
<p id="tec0001855"><span aria-label="41" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg41" role="doc-pagebreak"/>How had these mad numbers come about? What drove them? One way to answer this question is technical: it involves a description of financial instruments such as options (or derivatives) – the weapons of potential mass financial destruction, as Warren Buffet called them – which were the occasion, if not the cause, of the immense financial bubble that burst in the calamity of 2008.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter002_en_4" id="chapter002_en4" role="doc-noteref">4</a> These instruments, known as options, had been available under Bretton Woods, but it was only once Bretton Woods had died that bankers, liberated from their New Deal chains, were allowed to bet on the stock exchange, first with other people’s money and, later, with money – effectively conjured from thin air – lent in astronomical sums by the banks to … themselves.</p>
<p id="tec0001856">Conjured from thin air? To be clear, yes. Most people think that banks take Jill’s savings and lend them to Jack. That’s not what banks do. When a bank lends Jack money, it does not go into its vault to check it has enough cash to back the loan. If it believes Jack will return the loan, plus the agreed interest, all the bank needs to do is add to Jack’s account the number of dollars it lends him. Nothing more than a typewriter or, today, a few keystrokes on a keyboard are necessary.</p>
<p id="tec0001857">Now, if the Jacks of the world use their loans judiciously to make enough money to repay the loans plus the interest, all is well. But it is in the nature of banks to accommodate too many Jacks eager to borrow increasing amounts to keep paying each other more and more, while the banks collect huge profits from funding such a giant Ponzi scheme. Inevitably, this financial house of cards collapses – at which point the little people are crushed by global capitalism’s falling debris, as witnessed in the aftermath of 1929. Bretton Woods was designed to prevent such greed-fuelled recklessness from bringing humanity to the brink of another Great Depression, <span aria-label="42" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg42" role="doc-pagebreak"/>indeed another world war, ever again. But once it was gone, the bankers were free to run amok – again.</p>
<p id="tec0001858">Knowing you, your habitual risk aversion, and your reluctance to assume that powerful people are stupid, you would find this explanation unsatisfying. If you and I are clever enough to recognise the inherent instability of their financial house of cards, surely the bankers recognised it too? So why were they not terrified of what would happen if their various bets went south? There are a number of reasons. One is that they had developed a new way of profiting from loaning to Jack without depending on Jack’s ability or willingness to repay his loan. The trick was to lend to Jack, then immediately splice his loan into tiny pieces of debt and sell these pieces on – inside multiple, very complex financial ‘products’ – to unsuspecting buyers far away, who would themselves repackage and sell them on to someone else, and so on. This practice lulled Western bankers into a false sense of safety: Jack’s loan was no longer their problem. Even if Jack defaulted, his loan had been cut into so many tiny pieces that no single banker would bear the brunt of it. The risk had been shared and dispersed and thus minimised, they believed.</p>
<p id="tec0001859">Having internalised this belief they were able to internalise another: that prudence was for wimps and that smart people, like themselves, were actually giving capitalism a helpful boost. But by producing more and more debt, splicing it up in smaller and smaller pieces, and dispersing it across the planet, they were not minimising the risk, they were compounding it. Ruin loomed large over the horizon but financiers were simply unable to imagine that all these tiny pieces of debt, on which the West’s financial system rested, could crash in unison.</p>
<p id="tec0001860">‘Why?’ you ask. If this was so obvious to us, why did the <span aria-label="43" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg43" role="doc-pagebreak"/>super-smart bankers not consider the high probability of simultaneous defaults – of all the pieces of debt issued to the various Jacks going south all at once? To say that the bankers did not see this coming because they were caught up in a whirlwind of unchecked greed is to rephrase the question, not to answer it.</p>
<p id="tec0001861">Greed was not born in the 1980s. No, something else happened after the Nixon Shock killed off Bretton Woods. Something that helped the gambler’s madness infect Wall Street, magnifying greed in the process, generating these mad numbers. Whatever that something was, it must have been substantial, judging by its earth-shattering consequence: it shifted capitalist power from the economic sphere – i.e. from industry and commerce – to the financial sphere, the world of the bankers. What was it?</p>
<p id="tec0001862">You will be pleased to hear that the answer – my answer – evokes an ancient myth.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0001863"><em>The fearless Global Minotaur</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001864">Once upon a time, in the famous maze-like Labyrinth of the Cretan king’s palace, there lived a creature as fierce as it was tragic. Surviving in intense loneliness, comparable only to the fear it inspired far and wide, the Minotaur had a voracious appetite. Satisfying it was essential to maintaining the peace that King Minos had enforced, allowing trade to criss-cross the seas spreading prosperity’s benevolent reach to all. Alas, the beast’s appetite could only be satiated by human flesh. Every now and then, a ship loaded with youngsters sailed from faraway Athens bound for Crete. On arrival, it would deliver its human tribute to be devoured by the <span aria-label="44" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg44" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Minotaur. A gruesome ritual, albeit one that preserved the era’s peace and reproduced its prosperity.</p>
<p id="tec0001865">Millennia later another Minotaur rose up. Surreptitiously. From the ashes of the Bretton Woods system. Its lair, a form of Labyrinth, lay deep in the guts of America’s economy. It began life as the US trade deficit – the fact that America began to buy more imports from other countries than it sold to them owing to the Vietnam War, the Great Society and the expanding efficiency of German and Japanese factories. The tribute it consumed was the rest of the world’s exports, imported from Europe and Asia to be devoured in Middle America’s malls. The more the US deficit grew the greater the Minotaur’s appetite for Europe’s and, more so, Asia’s manufactured goods. However, what gave it strength and global significance – what meant that it ensured the peace and prosperity not just in America but in Europe and Asia too – were the labyrinthine underground tunnels connecting Walmart to Wall Street.</p>
<p id="tec0001866">The way it worked was as follows. The new American Minotaur’s appetite kept the gleaming German factories busy. It gobbled up everything produced in Japan and, later, in China. This kept Europe and Asia peaceful and prosperous (for now). In return, the foreign (and often the American) owners of these distant factories sent their profits, their cash, back to Wall Street to be invested – an additional form of tribute, which enriched America’s ruling class, despite its deficit. In this way, the Global Minotaur helped recycle financial capital (profits, savings, surplus money) <em>and</em> the rest-of-the-world’s net exports. Nourished on this constant stream of tributes, it enabled and sustained the post-Bretton Woods global order – much as its Cretan predecessor had preserved Pax Cretana in the mists of prehistory.</p>
<p id="tec0001867"><span aria-label="45" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg45" role="doc-pagebreak"/>This was the strategy that lay behind the Nixon Shock of 15 August 1971. And it worked wonders, at least for those who triggered it. You see, the writing had been on the wall for Bretton Woods since the mid to late 1960s. As America’s trade surplus began turning into a deficit, financiers began anticipating its demise. They knew that, sooner or later, the dollar–gold exchange rate, artificially set in 1944 at a fixed $35 per ounce, would depreciate. At that point, their stash of dollars would buy less gold. Naturally, they began eagerly exchanging their dollars for American gold before that happened. Had this continued, the United States would have run out of gold. The Nixon Shock stopped the rot.</p>
<p id="tec0001868">The dollar depreciated fast vis-à-vis gold, as anticipated, but curiously that was the moment the dollar regained its mojo. How? Shortly after the dollar was decoupled from gold, Europe’s currencies were decoupled from the dollar. Once they lost their fixed exchange with the dollar, the dollar value of European and Japanese money began fluctuating wildly, like driftwood in a tempestuous ocean. The dollar became the only safe harbour, courtesy of its exorbitant privilege: namely, that if any French, Japanese or Indonesian company, indeed anyone, wanted to import oil, copper, steel or even just space on a freight ship, they had to pay in dollars. The United States was, therefore, the only country in the world whose currency was in demand even by people who did not want to buy anything from it. That’s why, as a dark cloud of uncertainty descended upon Europe’s and Japan’s economic future, the world of finance responded by clamouring to turn their savings into dollars.</p>
<p id="tec0001869">Suddenly, the dollar became king and queen again. The Nixon Shock had produced a magic trick for the ages: the country going deeper and deeper into the red was the country <span aria-label="46" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg46" role="doc-pagebreak"/>whose currency, the dollar, was becoming more and more hegemonic. It was the epitome of paradox. The tumult unleashed by Nixon gave the world’s capitalists a strong impetus to dollarise their profits. It was to become an unmissable pattern. To this day, whenever Wall Street tanks, the moneymen’s reaction is to buy more dollars to send to … Wall Street!</p>
<p id="tec0001870">But there was another reason why the dollar’s hegemony grew: the intentional impoverishment of America’s working class. A cynic will tell you, quite accurately, that large quantities of money are attracted to countries where the profit rate is higher. For Wall Street to exercise fully its magnetic powers over foreign capital, profit margins in the United States had to catch up with profit rates in Germany and Japan. A quick and dirty way to do this was to suppress American wages: cheaper labour makes for lower costs makes for larger margins. It is no coincidence that, to this day, American working-class earnings languish, on average, below their 1974 level. It is also no coincidence that union busting became a thing in the 1970s, culminating in Ronald Reagan’s dismissal of every single unionised air traffic controller – a move emulated by Margaret Thatcher in Britain who pulverised whole industries in order to eliminate the trades unions that inhabited them. And faced with a Minotaur sucking most of the world’s capital into America, the European ruling classes reckoned they had no alternative but to do the same. Reagan had set the pace, Thatcher had shown the way. But it was in Germany, and later across continental Europe, that the new class war – you might call it universal austerity – was waged most effectively.</p>
<p id="tec0001871">A new era had begun. The post-war détente between capital and labour was now in its death throes. The final straw <span aria-label="47" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg47" role="doc-pagebreak"/>came in 1991, with the demise of the Soviet Union. Thereafter Russia and more importantly China voluntarily inducted themselves into globalised capitalism. Two billion low-waged workers entered the Minotaur’s realm. Western wages stagnated further. Profits swelled. The torrent of capital rushing to America to nourish the beast grew into a tsunami.</p>
<p id="tec0001872">And it was this tsunami of capital, rushing towards the United States, that gave the bankers of Wall Street the confidence, indeed the insane hubris, to conjure the mad numbers that you found so incomprehensible.</p>
<p id="tec0001873">The question I now hear you asking is perhaps the most important one of all: why did Nixon not try to <em>save</em> Bretton Woods? Even while devaluing the dollar vis-à-vis gold he could have kept the restrictions on bankers in place. He could have preserved the dollar’s fixed exchange rates with Europe’s and Japan’s currencies. What inspired this dramatic volte face among the rulers of the technostructure?</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0001874"><em>From uncontrollable discontent to controlled disintegration</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001875">It is 1965. Flower Power and Make Love Not War are in the air. Going against the grain, Don Draper explains his theory of love to a date: ‘What you call love was invented by guys like me to sell nylons.’ The fictional character (who, I insist, personifies the technostructure’s spirit) enlisted exaggerated cynicism to make a point: having created desires and expectations that ultimately its consumer products could not actually satisfy, and well before its economic foundation was trampled upon by the rampaging Minotaur, the technostructure was facing a backlash indicative of a society-wide spiritual crisis.</p>
<p id="tec0001876"><span aria-label="48" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg48" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The Vietnam War did much to radicalise the young after 1965. However, the young had been turning against their parents’ establishment, and inventing the ‘generation gap’, years before President Johnson escalated the war in Indochina. The discontent was ignited by the war but it was not caused by it. So why did America’s and Europe’s youth rise up in the mid to late sixties, at a time of full employment, sharply diminished inequality, new public universities and all the trappings of an expanding welfare state?</p>
<p id="tec0001877">Talking to himself, in another episode, Draper offers an answer in the form of the harshest self-criticism possible by a man who has dedicated his life to manufacturing desires: ‘We are flawed because we want so much more. We are ruined because we get these things and wish for what we had.’</p>
<p id="tec0001878">It is one thing for our dreams to go unfulfilled. It is quite another to sense that our unfulfilled dreams, our frustrated desires, have been manufactured by others. The more our mass-produced cravings are satisfied, the less satiated we feel. The greater the capacity of the technostructure to stir the passions, the greater the void within when they were served. To fill this void, young people felt in their bones the need to break with the established order, to rebel without a well-defined cause, to proclaim their moral outrage at the technostructure’s ways. The May 1968 uprisings, Woodstock, even the fervour with which the young threw themselves into the civil rights campaigns smacked of the rebelliousness that usually foreshadows a <em>fin de siècle</em>; the end of a regime and its replacement with something new.</p>
<p id="tec0001879">Young rebels who rejected the technostructure’s audacity to plan everything, their desires included, were not alone in feeling discontented. The 1950s and 60s had been a nightmare for true believers in capitalism as a natural system of <span aria-label="49" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg49" role="doc-pagebreak"/>spontaneous order. Wherever they turned their eyes, they saw centralised planning – not the splendid operation of freewheeling market forces that no planner, however well meaning, should be able to second-guess. Even if innocent of the way the technostructure was manufacturing desires and fixing prices, they could not help but notice the long hand of the state directing investment funds, preventing bankers from moving money, and fixing the dollar value of every other currency – including our drachma. To their free-marketeer eyes, the Global Plan was too close to Soviet planning for comfort. The West was, in short, psychologically prepared for a rupture like the Nixon Shock. Anti-capitalist youths and free-market zealots were both looking for a chance to bring down what they saw as a dying system.</p>
<p id="tec0001880">In the end, though, it was neither the hippy left nor the libertarian right that disintegrated the Global Plan. It was the work of functionaries who had served the technostructure well. We know this from the horse’s mouth, the former New Dealer who was at the centre of the 1971 Nixon Shock and who, between 1979 and 1987, chaired America’s central bank, the Fed. In a 1978 speech at Warwick University, Paul Volcker explained succinctly and cynically what they were up to: ‘[A] controlled disintegration in the world economy is a legitimate objective for the 1980s.’</p>
<p id="tec0001881">That’s exactly what the Nixon Shock was meant to do: just as a controlled implosion brings down an unwanted skyscraper, Bretton Woods was demolished to make way for America’s Global Minotaur. Lest you have any doubts, Volcker’s own words, from the same Warwick speech, say it all:</p>
<blockquote id="tec0001882">
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001883">[B]alancing the requirements of a stable international system against the desirability of retaining freedom of action <span aria-label="50" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg50" role="doc-pagebreak"/>for national policy, a number of countries, including the United States, opted for the latter …</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent" id="tec0001884">Where once stood the most stable global capitalist system ever, folks like Volcker were enthusiastically erecting the most unstable international system possible, founded on ceaselessly ballooning deficits, debts and gambles. Their controlled disintegration of Bretton Woods would soon complete the new global system. Most people refer to it as Globalisation or Financialisation. Under the perhaps excessive influence of your taste for the ancient parables, I call it capitalism’s Global Minotaur phase.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0001885"><em>The Minotaur’s favourite handmaidens: neoliberalism and the computer</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001886">The controlled disintegration of the old planned system and its replacement with the recalcitrant Minotaur was always going to hurt American workers. After decades of a hard, step-by-agonising-step slog up the socio-economic ladder, they were unceremoniously thrown off it and back to the pit of subsistence wages. How else could ever-increasing American deficits coexist with reinforced US hegemony and a fabulously richer American elite?</p>
<p id="tec0001887">In practice, Volcker’s controlled disintegration of the old system required, beyond the neutering of trades unions, an engineered recession in order to reduce workers’ bargaining power and the elimination of the shackles that President Roosevelt had slapped on bankers to restrain their recklessness. These were prerequisites for the Minotaur’s rise. But they were also big political asks with worldwide repercussions. As <span aria-label="51" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg51" role="doc-pagebreak"/>with every systemic transformation that hurts countless people, the cruelties necessary to bring it about had to be bathed in the light of a liberating, redemptive ideology. That’s where neoliberalism came in.</p>
<p id="tec0001888">Neither new nor liberal, neoliberalism was an uninteresting hodgepodge of older political philosophies. As a piece of theory, it had as much to do with really-existing capitalism as Marxism had to do with really-existing communism: nothing! Nevertheless, neoliberalism delivered the necessary ideological veneer to legitimise the assault on organised labour and to promote the so-called ‘deregulation’ that let Wall Street rip. Along with it came the revival of economic theories that humanity had, rightly, ditched during the Great Depression – theories artfully assuming that which they claimed to explain, such as the grand lie that deregulated financial markets know best.</p>
<p id="tec0001889">At around the same time, in the late 1970s, the first personal computers began to enter engineering, architecture and, of course, finance. The joke then was that to err is human but to mess things up seriously one needs a computer. Sadly, in high finance it was no joke. When earlier I gave even the most cursory explanation of the financial options, or derivatives, that were the occasion of the 2008 crash, you saw immediately that they were primed for destruction – all it took was a downturn in the underlying share prices. Why could the financiers not see this? My previous answer, that logic was trumped by profit-taking, was the truth, but not the whole truth. The missing part of the answer? Computers!</p>
<p id="tec0001890">Computers allowed financiers to complicate their gambles immensely. Instead of a simple option-to-sell boring old shares to Jill, Jack could now buy much snazzier options <span aria-label="52" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg52" role="doc-pagebreak"/>called derivatives. For example, he could buy a derivative that was in essence an option-to-buy a bundle containing shares in a variety of different companies plus bits of debts owed by homeowners in Kentucky, German corporations, even the Japanese government. As if that were not complex enough, Jack could also buy a derivative amounting to the option-to-buy a bundle of many such … derivatives that some super-computer would create. By the time these derivatives containing other derivatives had come out of the computer, not even the genius financial ‘engineer’ who created them could understand what was in them. Complexity thus became a great excuse not to delve into the derivatives that one bought. It liberated the Jills and the Jacks from the need to explain to themselves why they were buying them. Once computers had guaranteed that no one could possibly understand what these derivatives were made of, everyone wanted to buy them because … everyone was buying them. And as long as everybody was buying, anyone who could borrow huge amounts of money could become a billionaire (and avoid being branded a coward or a party-pooper or a loser by one’s colleagues) simply by purchasing them. For years, that’s exactly what was happening. Until, in 2008, it wasn’t.</p>
<p id="tec0001891">As a brief side note, you may well ask: when the bubble finally burst, why did we not let the bankers crash and burn? Why weren’t they held accountable for their absurd debts? For two reasons. First, because the payments system, the simple means of transferring a sum of money from one account to another and on which every transaction relies, is monopolised by the very same bankers who were making the bets. Imagine having gifted your arteries and veins to a gambler. The moment he loses big at the casino, he can blackmail <span aria-label="53" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg53" role="doc-pagebreak"/>you for anything you have simply by threatening to cut off your circulation. Second, because the financiers’ gambles contained, deep inside, the title deeds to the houses of the majority. A full-scale financial market collapse would, therefore, lead to mass homelessness and a complete breakdown in the social contract.</p>
<p id="tec0001892">Don’t be surprised that the high-and-mighty financiers of Wall Street would bother financialising the modest homes of poor people: having borrowed as much as they could off banks and rich clients in order to place their crazy bets, they craved more – since the more they bet the more they made. So they created more debt from scratch to use as raw material for more bets. How? By lending to impecunious blue-collar workers who dreamed of the security of owning their own home. What if these ‘little people’ could not actually afford their mortgage in the medium term? In contrast to bankers of old, the Jills and the Jacks who now lent them the money did not care if the repayments were made, because they never intended to collect. Instead, having granted the mortgage, they put it into their computerised grinder, chopped it up digitally into tiny pieces of debt, and repackaged them into one of their labyrinthine derivatives – which they would then sell at a profit. By the time the poor home ‘owner’ had defaulted and her home was repossessed, the financier who granted the loan in the first place had long since moved on.</p>
<p id="tec0001893">Back in the 1980s I remember a famous economist saying sarcastically that everywhere he looked he ‘saw’ the productivity gains brought on by computers – ‘everywhere’, he continued, ‘except in the productivity statistics’. He was right: just as the early generation of computers saved no paper, since we tended to print anything important out (often twice!), so too they did little to boost industrial output. But <span aria-label="54" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg54" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the computer did have an enormous impact on finance. It multiplied the complexity of financial instruments by hiding the ugliness within them. And it allowed for their frantic trading to accelerate almost to the speed of light.</p>
<p id="tec0001894">Can you now see how, by 2007, the world of finance had managed to place bets worth ten times more than humanity’s total income? Three were the handmaidens of this motivated madness: the torrents of money rushing to the American Minotaur, the computer-generated complexity of financial derivatives, and the neoliberal faith that markets know best.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0001895"><em>Back to your question</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0001896">‘Now that computers speak to each other, will this network make capitalism impossible to overthrow? Or might it finally reveal its Achilles heel?’</p>
<p id="tec0001897">You have been extremely patient with me. Everything in this chapter has danced around your question, offering merely a prelude to its answer: the great metamorphoses of capitalism that have taken place since the discovery of electromagnetism. But I must ask for your patience just a little more.</p>
<p id="tec0001898">First, I need to get something off my chest. Upon hearing your question, I felt a tinge of sadness. For the first time, you were no longer confidently instructing me – explaining how technological change shattered the existing social order, propelled history, and engendered progress, accompanied by Hesiod-like lamentations of what had been lost. No, suddenly you were asking <em>me</em> to explain a technological and social transformation to <em>you</em>! The inexplicable sadness begins to <span aria-label="55" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg55" role="doc-pagebreak"/>make sense. The question – did the internet do to capitalism that which iron’s magic had done to prehistory, or did it render capitalism invincible? – is not just hard to answer. The responsibility of answering it marked a rite of passage, a final curtain on a blessed childhood. It put the onus on me to carry forward <em>your</em> method of thinking.</p>
<p id="tec0001899">So now, let me try to do that: No, Dad, even though it gave capitalism a breathtaking boost for a couple of decades, the internet did not render capitalism invincible. But nor did it prove, on its own, its Achilles heel, as I initially suggested. What the internet did to capitalism was more subtle: in conjunction with the attention market that the technostructure had fabricated, and under circumstances created by the Minotaur’s spectacular rise, not to mention its 2008 fall, the internet shattered capitalism’s evolutionary fitness. And as I shall explain in the next chapter, it did this by incubating a new form of capital, which has ultimately empowered its owners to break free of capitalism and become a whole new ruling class of their own.</p>
<p id="tec0001900">Yes, <em>capital</em> still exists and flourishes, even though capital<em>ism</em> does not. None of this ought to surprise you – after all, it is what you taught me. As consecutive mutations multiply the variants of an organism until, at some point, a brand-new species appears, so technological change proceeds within a social system until, suddenly, the system has been transformed into something quite distinct, though that doesn’t mean that all of the materials out of which the system is built – capital, labour, money – have necessarily changed. Improvements in navigation and shipbuilding did not end feudalism on their own. However, when the resulting trade volumes and accumulated merchant wealth reached a critical mass, they triggered the commodification of land, <span aria-label="56" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg56" role="doc-pagebreak"/>then of labour, soon after of almost everything. Before anyone knew it, feudalism had morphed into capitalism.</p>
<p id="tec0001901">Similarly with the technostructure, which contained markets during and after the war; with Don Draper’s <em>Mad Men</em>, who turned our attention into a vital commodity; and with the Nixon Shock, whose demolition of the Global Plan enabled Wall Street’s mad numbers to fund the rise of the Minotaur. None of these developments overthrew capitalism but can be thought of as mutations in its DNA that led to a series of remarkable metamorphoses as it adapted and evolved, like a virus facing a miscellany of vaccines. But there comes a time when something has evolved so much that it is probably best to call it something else.</p>
<p id="tec0001902">Before we delve into capitalism’s final metamorphosis, into what I call technofeudalism, it is perhaps apt to dedicate a few final words to the Global Minotaur – the metaphorical beast standing in for the US-centred global recycling system which, between the late 1970s and 2008, delivered all the props of our present drama: Big Finance, Big Tech, neoliberalism, industrial-scale inequality, not to mention democracies so atrophied that films like <em>Don’t Look Up</em> are necessary to explain humanity’s paralysis in the face of climate catastrophe.</p>
<p id="tec0001903">So, here comes the briefest of eulogies: the Cretan Minotaur was slain by an Athenian prince, Theseus. Its death ended prehistory and ushered in the classical era of tragedy, history, philosophy. Our era’s Minotaur died less heroically: a victim of cowardly Wall Street bankers whose hubris was rewarded with massive state bailouts that did nothing to resuscitate the Minotaur. For while the American deficit returned with a vengeance a year after the crash of 2008 and the subsequent bankers’ bailouts, it never restored the beast’s capacity to recycle the world’s profits.</p>
<p id="tec0001904"><span aria-label="57" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg57" role="doc-pagebreak"/>True, the rest of the world continued to send most of its profits to Wall Street. But the recycling mechanism was broken: only a small fraction of the monies rushing to Wall Street returned in the form of tangible investments into factories, technologies, agriculture. Most of the world’s money rushed to Wall Street to stay in Wall Street. There, it sloshed around doing nothing useful. As it piled up, it bid up share prices, thus giving the Jills and the Jacks of finance yet another opportunity to do stupid things at a mammoth scale.</p>
<p id="tec0001905">Some of us had dared hope that the Minotaur’s passing might help us build a new system where wealth no longer needs poverty to flourish and development is thought of in terms of better rather than more. Those of a hyper-optimistic disposition went so far as to dream of the day when exploitation withered, politics was democratised – perhaps even with the help of the internet – and our environment’s resilience trumped other priorities. Such hopes faded after 2009, and although for some they were revived during the next big crisis, the pandemic, it was not to be.</p>
<p id="tec0001906">Our Minotaur will, in the end, be remembered as a sad, boisterous beast whose thirty-year reign created, and then destroyed, the illusion that capitalism can be stable, greed a virtue and finance productive. By dying, it forced capitalism into its last and fatal metamorphosis, birthing a system where power is in the hands of even fewer individuals, who own a brave new type of capital.</p>
