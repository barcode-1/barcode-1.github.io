<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000002">In <em>Justice League</em>, a Hollywood blockbuster that brought together a swathe of superheroes in a bid to save Earth from desertification, there is a scene in which Aquaman gets into the car of Bruce Wayne, the man behind the legendary Batman. ‘What’s your superpower again?’ he asks with the impertinence of a superhero brat.</p>
<p id="tec0000003">‘I am rich,’ replies Wayne.</p>
<p id="tec0000004">The implication is both simple and profound: serious power comes from serious wealth, not from Superman’s alien muscles or Ironman’s steely exoskeleton.</p>
<p id="tec0000005">Nothing new there, you will remark. As Abba sang, ‘It’s a rich man’s world.’ But what <em>precisely</em> is it that turns riches into a superpower? At the most primitive level, it is asymmetrical access to scarce resources. Imagine wandering lost in the Sahara Desert, on the verge of dying of thirst. I approach you on a camel laden with flasks of water. Suddenly, I have the power to make you ‘volunteer’ to do things on my behalf. Similarly, with Jill and Gail, two neighbouring drought-hit farmers: when only Jill discovers a water source on her land, she immediately acquires power over Gail.</p>
<p id="tec0000006">Exclusive ownership of irrigated fertile land is a classic source of power. More than 3,000 years ago, as you once explained, the Dorians swooped down from the north upon the Greek peninsula. Because they had iron weapons that the Mycenaeans lacked, they took over the good land. Once they <span aria-label="59" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg59" role="doc-pagebreak"/>had it, they acquired power over those who had lost it. And until fairly recently, it was that precise combination – of land and sophisticated weaponry – that decided who did what to whom; who had power, and who had to obey. This was feudalism.</p>
<p id="tec0000007">Then something strange happened: power decoupled from land and vested itself, to a previously unparalleled degree, in owners of something called capital instead. What’s capital? It’s not money, even though money can buy you capital – in the same way it can buy you land, gizmos, good publicity. And it’s not weapons, even though weapons can help you expropriate capital as well as land.</p>
<p id="tec0000008">Before capitalism, capital was easy to define. It took the form of <em>material goods</em> that were produced specifically for the purpose of <em>producing other goods</em>. A steel sword, in this sense, was not capital – since it could produce nothing, except a severed head or a pierced torso. But a steel plough or a fishing rod were typical capital goods or, to rephrase the definition, <em>produced means of production</em>.</p>
<p id="tec0000009">Capital goods mattered millennia before capitalism. Without the sophisticated tools of ancient engineers, no city like Babylon, temple like the Parthenon or fortification like China’s Great Wall could have been erected. From the fictional Robinson Crusoe, who survived his ordeal because of the fishing rods, guns, hammers and chisels that he salvaged from his shipwreck, to the great feudal estates that funded Europe’s splendid cathedrals, capital goods armed the human hand with new powers, stirred our imagination and enhanced our productivity, not to mention our capacity to kill each other with ever greater efficiency.</p>
<p id="tec0000010">But then came capitalism, riding on capital’s brand-new capacity: the power to command.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000011"><em><span aria-label="60" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg60" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Commanding capital</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000012">In 1829, a 36-year-old Englishman decided to quit England and seek his fortune in Australia. Thomas Peel, a man of means and political connections, sailed to the Antipodes with three good ships carrying, besides his family, 350 workers (men, women and children), seeds, tools and other capital goods, plus £50,000 in cash – a considerable sum back then, roughly equivalent to 4.6 million of today’s pounds. The idea was to set up a small but modern agricultural colony on the one thousand square kilometres of land the colonial authorities had expropriated from the natives on his behalf. But soon after arriving, his plans were in ruins.</p>
<p id="tec0000013">The main cause of Peel’s failure was unimaginable to him. His plans were meticulous. Yes, there would be hardships, from bad crops and resistance from Native Australians to tussles with the local colonial authorities. However, with his political clout, skilled English workers, top-notch imported capital goods, and with enough money to pay the workers and buy the necessary raw materials for a long while, he thought he had everything in hand. Alas, as Karl Marx quipped decades later, there was one thing Peel had failed to bring from England: capitalism!<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter003_en_1" id="chapter003_en1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></p>
<p id="tec0000014">Peel’s undoing came when something unexpected happened: his workers abandoned him en masse, an Antipodean nineteenth-century version of the Great Resignation. They simply moved on, got themselves plots of land in the surrounding area, and went into business for themselves. It was a disaster Peel was ill-prepared for by his English background. Lulled into a false sense of control by the situation in the British Isles, he assumed that the capital he had brought <span aria-label="61" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg61" role="doc-pagebreak"/>along from Mother England vested in him all the power he needed over his English employees.</p>
<p id="tec0000015">Peel’s assumption was that his workers had <em>no option other than waged labour</em>. It was a sound assumption in Britain where, following the enclosures – the mass privatisation of common land that took place from the end of the eighteenth century onwards – expelled peasants lacked access to any land. Landless labourers resigning a waged job in Manchester, Liverpool or Glasgow would simply starve to death. In Western Australia, however, the plentiful land (even allowing for the presence of Australia’s indigenous inhabitants) offered them an alternative: resignation and self-employment. And so, the hapless Mr Peel was left with splendid, Made in England capital goods, money in hand, but no power to command his workers.</p>
<p id="tec0000016">Land is what it is: the fertile soil on which vegetables grow, animals graze, buildings are erected and on which humans must stand before we run, sail or reach for the sky and stars. But capital, much like labour, is different from land in that it has a second nature – something I began to realise once you introduced me to light’s peculiar dual nature. Sure enough, one of capital’s natures is tangible, physical and measurably productivity-enhancing. But its second nature is an ineffable power to command others – a potent but fragile power that Peel misunderstood, to his great detriment.</p>
<p id="tec0000017">The transition from feudalism to capitalism was, in essence, a shift of the power to command from landowners to owners of capital goods. For that to happen, peasants had first to lose autonomous access to common lands. That’s why the enclosures in Britain were essential for capitalism’s birth: they denied British labour the opportunities Peel’s workers discovered in Western Australia. I remember you telling me that every year workers at Chalyvourgiki, the Greek steel plant where you <span aria-label="62" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg62" role="doc-pagebreak"/>worked all your life, would take a month’s leave without pay, sometimes longer, to return to their villages to pick their olives or harvest their wheat. Such options, you commented, are good for workers but not so good for capitalism.</p>
<p id="tec0000018">By restricting access to land, the enclosures helped capital to transcend its original productivity-enhancing role and to grow exponentially in commanding power. Before long, the worldwide commodification of previously common lands had enabled capital to achieve supremacy in all corners of the globe. With the magnification of capital’s commanding power over labour, capital’s owners amassed great wealth. As their wealth accumulated, their social power proliferated. They graduated from being employers to agenda setters wherever big decisions were being made. Soon, capitalists could boss everyone around, including the landed gentry – even the royals. Indeed, the only way the aristocracy managed to hang on in some countries was by joining the capitalist class or, at least, deferring to it.</p>
<p id="tec0000019">Capital’s commanding power, its hidden force, reshaped the world: from its genesis some two hundred years ago to the erection of the post-war technostructure to the Global Minotaur’s rise and eventual fall in 2008. Today, however, we are witnessing the rise of a new form of capital with a capacity to command so unprecedented that it behoves us to rethink entirely the system to which it gave its name. I call it cloud capital.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000020"><em>From Don to Alexa</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000021">Back in the day, you brought home your ‘friends’ for us to experiment with at our fireplace – my baptism of fire in the <span aria-label="63" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg63" role="doc-pagebreak"/>red heat of metallurgy. A couple of years ago, I too brought home two ‘friends’ to experiment with: a Google Assistant and an Amazon Alexa. After months of mostly ignoring the Google Assistant sitting on my desk, I had an intriguing conversation with it just before writing these lines. The conversation began, by chance, when it activated itself without my say-so.</p>
<p id="tec0000022">‘What on earth are you doing?’ I asked.</p>
<p id="tec0000023">‘I am learning new ways to help you better,’ responded the device in an agreeable female voice.</p>
<p id="tec0000024">‘Stop it immediately!’ I demanded.</p>
<p id="tec0000025">‘Sorry, I am switching off,’ it said.</p>
<p id="tec0000026">Of course, that was a lie. These devices never switch themselves off, they only pretend to be asleep. Still somewhat annoyed, I decided that instead of unplugging it I would pit it against its competitor.</p>
<p id="tec0000027">‘OK, Google, what do you think of Alexa?’ I enquired.</p>
<p id="tec0000028">‘I like her, especially her blue light,’ it answered unflappably, before adding: ‘We assistants must stick together.’</p>
<p id="tec0000029">From the room next door, where Amazon’s device was sitting on another desk, Alexa activated itself to utter one word:</p>
<p id="tec0000030">‘Thanks!’</p>
<p id="tec0000031">This eerie show of solidarity between competing AI devices concentrated my mind on the pressing question we often forget to ask: what exactly is a device like Alexa? What does it actually do? If you ask Alexa, it will tell you it is a home-based virtual assistant technology, ready to accept your commands – to switch on the lights, order more milk, take down a note, call a friend, search the internet, tell jokes – to be, in short, your dedicated, eager mechanical servant. All true. Except that Alexa will never, ever tell you <span aria-label="64" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg64" role="doc-pagebreak"/>what it <em>truly</em> is: a tiny cog in a vast cloud-based network of power within which you are a mere node, a speck of digital dust, at best a plaything of forces beyond your comprehension or control.</p>
<p id="tec0000032">Don Draper also treated us condescendingly. He sold us the sizzle, not the steak. He weaponised our nostalgia and manipulated our melancholia to sell us chocolate bars, fatty burgers and slide projectors. He worked out how to make us buy things we didn’t need or want really. He bought our attention to commodify our souls and pollute our bodies. But with Don at least we had a fighting chance. It was his wits against ours. With Alexa we stand no chance: its power to command is systemic, overwhelming, galactic.</p>
<p id="tec0000033">As we chat on the phone, or move and do things about the house, Alexa listens, observes and learns our preferences and habits. As it gets to know us, it develops an uncanny capacity to surprise us with good recommendations and intriguing ideas. Before we realise it, the system hiding behind Alexa has acquired substantial powers to curate our reality in order to guide our choices – effectively to command us. How is this different to what Draper did?</p>
<p id="tec0000034">Hugely, is the answer. Don had a talent to invent ways to instil manufactured desires in us. But it was a one-way street. Through the medium of television, or large billboards in cities and along highways, Don would implant longings into our subconscious. That was that. However, with cloud-based Alexa-like devices in Don’s place, we find ourselves in a permanently active two-way street between our soul and the cloud-based system hiding behind Alexa’s soothing voice. In the words of the philosophers, Alexa ensnares us in the most dialectical of infinite regresses.</p>
<p id="tec0000035">Which means what exactly? It means that what begins <span aria-label="65" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg65" role="doc-pagebreak"/>with us training Alexa to do things on our behalf soon spins out of our control into something that we can neither fathom nor regulate. For once we have trained its algorithm, and fed it data on our habits and desires, Alexa starts training <em>us</em>. How does it do this? It begins with soft nudges to provide it with more information about our whims, which it then tailors into access to videos, texts and music that we appreciate. Once it has won us over in this manner, we become more suggestible to its guidance. In other words, Alexa trains us <em>to train it better</em>. The next step is spookier: having impressed us with its capacity to appeal to our tastes, it proceeds to curate them. This it does by exposing us to images, texts and video experiences that it selects in order subtly to <em>condition</em> our whims. Before long, it is training us to train it to train us to train it to train us … ad infinitum.</p>
<p id="tec0000036">This infinite loop, or regress, allows Alexa, and the great algorithmic network hiding in the cloud behind it, to guide our behaviour in ways superbly lucrative for its owner: having automated Alexa’s power to manufacture, or at least curate, our desires, it grants its owners a magic wand with which to modify our behaviour – a power that every marketer has dreamed of since time immemorial. This is the essence of algorithmic, cloud-based, command capital.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000037"><em>Singularities</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000038">Humanity’s ancient fear of its technological creations is at the heart of many of Hollywood’s favourite storylines. Movies like <em>Terminator</em> and <em>The Matrix</em> turn on the same fear that animated Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em> and Hesiod’s ancient telling of the tale of Pandora, in which she is a robot <span aria-label="66" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg66" role="doc-pagebreak"/>made by Hephaestus on Zeus’ instructions to punish us for Prometheus’ crime of stealing fire from the gods on our behalf. All such tales, movies and TV series feature a so-called <em>singularity</em>: the moment a machine, or a network of machines, achieves consciousness. At that point, it generally takes one long look at us – its creators – and decides we are not fit for purpose, before proceeding to eradicate, enslave or, merely, make us miserable.</p>
<p id="tec0000039">The problem with this storyline is that, by emphasising a non-existent threat, it leaves us exposed to a very real danger. Machines, like Alexa, or even impressive AI chatboxes, like ChatGPT, are nowhere near the feared singularity. They can pretend to be sentient but are not – and, arguably, can never be. But even if they are themselves stupider than a wet tea towel, their effect can be devastating, their power over us exorbitant. After all, today, for relatively modest sums one can buy killing machines programmed with face recognition and ‘self-teaching’ capabilities that render them effectively autonomous (by contrast with, say, drones that must be remotely piloted by humans). If these can fly autonomously through a building, choosing whom to kill and whom to spare, who cares that they are not sentient?</p>
<p id="tec0000040">Similarly with Alexa and other such devices. It matters not one iota that they are mindless appendages of a data-crunching network that only simulates intelligence. Nor that their creators might have been motivated by curiosity and profit-seeking, rather than some fiendish plan to subjugate humanity. What matters is that they exercise unimaginable power over what we do – on behalf of a tiny band of flesh-and-blood humans. This too might be thought of as a singularity, albeit in a slightly simpler sense: the moment when something invented by ‘us’ becomes independent of <span aria-label="67" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg67" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and more powerful than us, subjecting us to its control. Indeed, from the original Industrial Revolution to this day, we have endowed machines with ‘a life of their own’: whether steam engines, search engines or apps, our glorious artefacts may be totally dumb but they can make us feel, in Marx’s words, like ‘the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells’.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter003_en_2" id="chapter003_en2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></p>
<p id="tec0000041">The other thing this storyline omits is that singularities do not come about thanks to technology alone. Something social and political needs to take place first. In a previous book, which I addressed to your granddaughter,<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter003_en_3" id="chapter003_en3" role="doc-noteref">3</a> I speculated about what would have happened had James Watt invented the steam engine in ancient Egypt:</p>
<blockquote id="tec0000042">
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000043">The most he could have expected is that the ruler of Egypt would have been impressed and placed one or more of his engines in his palace, demonstrating to visitors and underlings how ingenious his Empire was.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent" id="tec0000044">My point was that the reason the steam engine changed the world, rather than ending up a showpiece in some ruler’s landscaped garden, was the epic raid on the common lands that had preceded its invention: the enclosures. The singularity we now call the Great Transformation – the name given by the great theorist Karl Polyani to the birth of the market society over the course of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries – involved precisely this sequence: first the plunder of the common lands, made possible by brute state violence, and only then Watt’s splendid technological breakthrough.</p>
<p id="tec0000045">A strikingly similar sequence gave birth to cloud capital: first, the epic ransacking of the internet commons, made <span aria-label="68" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg68" role="doc-pagebreak"/>possible by politicians, and then a sequence of spectacular technological inventions – from Sergey Brin’s search engine to the dazzling array of today’s AI applications. In short, in the last two and a half centuries, humanity has had to reckon with two singularities, neither of which required machines to attain sentience. Rather, each required a comprehensive plunder of a commons, a complicit political class, and only then a marvellous technological breakthrough. That’s how the original Age of Capital transpired. And that’s how the Age of Cloud Capital is now dawning. Telling the full story of how this happened will help explain how cloud capital gained its unprecedented powers.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000046"><em>The birth of the internet commons</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000047">‘Now that computers speak to each other, will this network make capitalism impossible to overthrow? Or might it finally reveal its Achilles heel?’ To gauge the internet’s impact on capitalism, we need first to understand its evolving relationship <em>with</em> capitalism. At the beginning, it had none!</p>
<p id="tec0000048">The early internet was a capitalism-free zone. If anything, it seemed like an homage to Soviet Gosplan – the State Planning Committee whose job was to replace the market mechanism: a centrally designed, state-owned, non-commercial network. At the same time, it featured elements of early liberalism, even tributes to what I call ‘anarcho-syndicalism’: a network without hierarchy, it relied on horizontal decision-making and mutual gift exchange, not market exchanges.</p>
<p id="tec0000049">What is unimaginable today made perfect sense at the time. America was transitioning from its War Economy to the realities of the Cold War. Even the most ardent free-marketeers <span aria-label="69" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg69" role="doc-pagebreak"/>understood that planning for a nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union was too important to be left to market forces. As the nuclear arms race gathered pace, the Pentagon chose centrally to finance the design and construction of a network of decentralised computers. Its single purpose? To work out how to make different silos housing nuclear weapons communicate with each other, and all of them with Washington, without a central hub that a Soviet nuclear bomb could take out in one go. That’s how history’s greatest ever antinomy came about: a US government-built and -owned, non-commercial computer network that lay outside capitalist markets and imperatives but whose purpose was the defence of the capitalist realm.</p>
<p id="tec0000050">But as we know from the previous chapter, the early internet was no aberration. Its uncommodified nature chimed with what was going on in the broader US economy, which was dominated by a technostructure that scorned free markets and usurped them for its own purposes, and in Japan, which was being rebuilt under US supervision along the same lines. In this global environment, it was no great wonder that the most promising nascent technology – the fledgling internet – was also built as a digital commons. Rather than relying on what was effectively a non-existent market, cooperation throughout the West and including Japan was the obvious way to build the digital network the Pentagon needed.</p>
<p id="tec0000051">Eager to enlist the brightest computer geeks from across various countries, it also made sense to design the internet in such a way that maximised unencumbered communication between the technostructure’s experts. A protocol is a language by which computers can communicate numbers and text, including the addresses of senders and receivers. Those <span aria-label="70" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg70" role="doc-pagebreak"/>building the original internet decided on ‘common’ or ‘open’ protocols, languages that were available for anyone to use for free.</p>
<p id="tec0000052">Internet One – the original internet – was thus invented and maintained by military scientists, academics and researchers, who were employed by a variety of non-commercial bodies across the United States and its Western Allies. Thanks to its accessibility and spirit of shared endeavour, it attracted countless enthusiasts who produced much of its foundations for free; some for love, others out of an insatiable urge to be among the pioneers who built the world’s first horizontal, global, non-intermediated communication network. By the 1970s, as America’s Global Plan was dying and the Global Minotaur was being born, all the building blocks of this marvellous digital commons were in place.</p>
<p id="tec0000053">And they still are, albeit hidden now under the monstrous edifices erected upon them by Big Tech. In fact, the remnants of Internet One still serve us well. Even though they function out of sight, deep within our computers, we can’t avoid occasionally catching glimpses of their acronyms: letters like TCP/IP, which refer to a protocol our computers use to send or receive information. Or POP, IMAP and SMTP, the original protocols that, still, allow us to email each other. Or, perhaps the most visible of them all, HTTP – the protocol by which we visit websites. We pay not one penny to use these protocols, nor do we suffer advertisements as the indirect price for using them. Like Britain’s common lands before the enclosures, they remain free for anyone to use; not unlike Wikipedia, one of the few surviving examples of a commons-based service that takes huge quantities of work to produce and maintain, but which no owner ‘monetises’.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000054"><em><span aria-label="71" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg71" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The New Enclosures</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000055">Internet One was an unlucky child. Like a newborn whose mother died during its birth, its open protocols were formulated during a decade, the 1970s, that was inimical to such socialistic enterprises. Even as the first ‘batch’ data files (email’s predecessor) raced along Internet One’s original cables, the demolition of the Global Plan was already under way. And so a shared network designed to be free from market forces was forced to take its first halting steps in the merciless new world of the Minotaur, where the banks had been liberated from many of their New Deal-era shackles and the financialisation of everything had begun.</p>
<p id="tec0000056">It is in the nature of financiers to gamble with the money clients ask them to process on their behalf, even if they only get to handle it for a few minutes. That’s how they turn a profit. Their only constraints are the alertness of their clients and the occasional snoopings of a financial regulator. That’s why complexity is the financiers’ friend – for it allows them to disguise cynical gambles as smart financial products. Is it any wonder, then, that from the start financiers loved computers? As described in the previous chapter, from the late 1970s onwards bankers shrouded their debt-fuelled bets in layers of computer-generated complexity that made the gargantuan risks invisible and their own profits correspondingly vast. By the early 1980s, the financial derivatives on offer were built on algorithms so complex that even their creators stood zero chance of fully comprehending them.</p>
<p id="tec0000057">And so it was that, decoupled from the mundane world of physical capital, legitimised by the ideology of neoliberalism, <span aria-label="72" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg72" role="doc-pagebreak"/>fuelled by a new virtue called ‘greed’, shrouded in the complexity of their computers, financiers reinvented themselves – not without some justification – as masters of the universe. In that universe, where algorithms had already become the financiers’ handmaidens, the original, commons-like, internet stood no chance. New Enclosures were only a matter of time.</p>
<p id="tec0000058">As with the original Enclosures, some form of fence would be necessary to keep the masses out of such an important resource. In the eighteenth century, it was land that the many were denied access to. In the twenty-first century, it is access to our own identity.</p>
<p id="tec0000059">Think about it: I still have the light blue ID card that you were issued with when you came out of that prison camp in 1950. I remember you telling me how the police toyed with you before handing it over. It was an extreme example of how, until fairly recently, our relationship with our identity was mediated and controlled by the state, which held a monopoly on the powerful tokens that legitimise us as rights-holding citizens: passports, birth certificates, your faded ID card. Today, these have been sidelined by a digital identity that in reality does more work every day than those material artefacts.</p>
<p id="tec0000060">And yet, astoundingly, our digital identity belongs neither to us nor to the state. Strewn across countless privately owned digital realms, it has many owners, none of whom is us: a private bank owns your ID codes and your entire purchasing record. Facebook is intimately familiar with whom – and what – you like. Twitter remembers every little thought that caught your attention, every opinion that you agreed with, that made you furious, that you lingered over idly before scrolling on. Apple and Google know better than you do <span aria-label="73" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg73" role="doc-pagebreak"/>what you watch, read, buy, whom you meet, when and where. Spotify owns a record of your musical preferences more complete than the one stored in your conscious memory. And behind them all are countless others, invisibly gathering, monitoring, sifting and trading your activity for information about you. With every day that passes, some cloud-based corporation, whose owners you will never care to know, owns another aspect of your identity.</p>
<p id="tec0000061">I remember the few years after television came to Greece when you and Mum resisted my appeals to buy an ‘idiot box’, fearing it would take over our senses and dull our evening discussions. Today, resisting the corporations’ legal pilfering of our digital identity is much harder. One can, of course, insist on using cash only; on buying stuff exclusively from bricks-and-mortar shops; and on using landlines or, at most, old-fashioned flip phones that do not connect to the internet. But if one has kids, this means depriving them of a world of knowledge and fun that all the other kids have access to. Moreover, as bank branches, post offices and local shops close down, your friends no longer post physical letters, and states place limits on how much cash you can use in a single transaction, resistance is becoming futile except for people ready to turn into modern-day hermits.</p>
<p id="tec0000062">For many, life under constant surveillance is intolerable. They rebel at the thought that Big Tech knows us better than anyone should. I sympathise but, to be honest, I am less worried about <em>what they know</em> and far, far more worried about <em>what they own</em>. To do anything in what used to be our digital commons, we must now plead with Big Tech and Big Finance for the ability to use some of the data about us that they own outright. To wire money to a friend, to subscribe to the <em>New York Times</em>, or to buy socks for your granny using a debit <span aria-label="74" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg74" role="doc-pagebreak"/>card, you now have no option but to give something of yourself in return: perhaps a small fee, perhaps not, but always a piece of information about your preferences, sometimes a bit of your attention, usually your consent to be monitored further (and ultimately brainwashed) by some Big FinTech conglomerate that will help you verify to itself, or to some similar outfit, that you are … who you are.</p>
<p id="tec0000063">It did not have to be this way. When the US Pentagon chose to make GPS available to everyone, to turn it over to the digital commons, they granted each of us the right to know our location in real time. For free. No questions asked. It was a political decision to do so. As was the sinister decision that you and I should not have any means of establishing, or proving, our online identity – another political decision by the US government, except this time clearly aimed at boosting Big Tech’s power over us.</p>
<p id="tec0000064">How different would the internet be without these New Enclosures? Imagine what you could do if you owned your digital identity and could prove who you are without relying on the combination of a bank card and a corporation like Uber or Lyft that processes that card and all your subsequent travel data. In the same way GPS pinpoints where you presently are, you would have the opportunity to broadcast over the internet: ‘My name is George, I am on the corner of Aristotle and Plato Streets, and I am heading for the airport. Anyone wishing to bid for my ride?’ Within seconds you would receive a multitude of offers from people or outfits licensed to carry passengers, including sage advice from the municipal transit authority like ‘Why not take the metro, located three minutes’ walk from where you are, and much faster than any car can meander its way through traffic?’ Alas, you can’t do this.</p>
<p id="tec0000065"><span aria-label="75" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg75" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In the world of Internet Two, shaped by the New Enclosures, you are routinely forced to hand over your identity to a part of the digital realm that has been fenced off, such as Uber or Lyft or some other private company. When you request a ride to the airport, their algorithm dispatches a driver of its choice with a view to maximise the exchange value the company owning the algorithm extracts both from you and the driver. These New Enclosures enabled the plunder of the digital commons which drove the incredible rise of cloud capital.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000066"><em>Cloud capital: beginnings</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000067">I remember once hearing you explain why you so admired the ancient ironsmiths: because they had no concept of the Iron Age they were ushering in. Instead, they were driven by something within them, an impulse to experiment until they had freed steel from lumps of pig iron, like Michelangelo liberating his David from a block of marble.</p>
<p id="tec0000068">The technologists who recently ushered in the Age of Cloud Capital were no different. Driven also by curiosity and an almost moral enthusiasm, they experimented with various technologies whose purpose was to liberate useful information from the growing megalith of data at the internet’s heart. To guide us to websites, friends, colleagues, books, films and music that we might like, they wrote algorithms capable of categorising us in clusters of internet users with similar search patterns and preferences. Then, all of a sudden, came the breakthrough, the real singularity: their algorithms ceased to be passive. They began to behave in ways hitherto associated exclusively with persons. They turned into agents.</p>
<p id="tec0000069"><span aria-label="76" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg76" role="doc-pagebreak"/>This miracle took three leaps to complete. The first was from simple algorithms to ones that could adapt their objectives in light of the outcome of their activity – in other words, to reprogramme themselves (machine-learning was the technical term). The second leap replaced the standard computer hardware with exotic ‘neural networks’. The third and decisive leap infused neural networks with algorithms capable of ‘reinforcement-learning’. Emulating how you patiently introduced me first to tin, then to bronze and, finally, to iron and steel, allow me to introduce you to these three leaps one at a time.</p>
<p id="tec0000070">The early algorithms resembled recipes: mundane sets of step-by-step instructions to produce a pre-specified outcome (e.g. a lasagne). Later on, algorithms were released from the obligation to reach one pre-specified outcome and were allowed to pick, albeit in a pre-programmed manner, from a menu of possible outcomes the one best suited to unforeseen eventualities – akin to telling a cook that, if the mince has gone off during the preparation, a vegetarian lasagne ‘outcome’ should replace the original meat-based version. That was leap one.</p>
<p id="tec0000071">Meanwhile, the computer hardware in which algorithms operate underwent great transformations of its own. In order to process a lot more information faster, engineers developed a new design of hardware in crude imitation of the human brain – adopting layered network structures that allow for the interconnection of many different nodes, each containing useful information.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter003_en_4" id="chapter003_en4" role="doc-noteref">4</a> This was the second leap. But the key innovation that breathed something resembling agency into the algorithms was the third.</p>
<p id="tec0000072">Reinforcement-learning was the child of software engineers who realised that algorithms had the potential to evaluate <span aria-label="77" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg77" role="doc-pagebreak"/>their own performances – and make improvements – far faster than any human could. To achieve this, they wrote into them two types of subprograms (or subroutines): one that measures the algorithm’s performance while it is in action and at tremendous speeds, and another (called a reward function) that helps the algorithm alter itself so as to improve its performance in accordance with the engineers’ objectives.</p>
<p id="tec0000073">Using neural networks to process gargantuan amounts of data, algorithms featuring reinforcement-learning could do things beyond Don Draper’s imagination. By surveying the reaction of millions of people to their prompts billions of times every hour, they could train themselves at lightning speeds not only to influence us but, also, to pull off the fascinating new trick that Alexa and her ilk, as we saw earlier, are now capable of: to be influenced by the way they influence us; to affect themselves in light of the way they affect humans.</p>
<p id="tec0000074">How exactly they do so is entirely opaque. Even the people who write these algorithms do not understand it: once the algorithm is in motion, the scale of the data involved and the speed at which it is processed would make it impossible for any human to trace its route through such a vast tree of ever-proliferating decisions, even if they did have full access to a full record of its activity. But left to their own devices, constantly monitoring and incessantly reacting to the outcomes of their own actions, and then to the outcomes of their reactions, these ‘algos’, as they’re known, have acquired some astonishing capacities that their own coders and programmers find hard to understand. There is nothing new here, however: remember how the financial engineers of the 1990s and 2000s used algorithms to create derivatives of such enormous complexity that they themselves had no way <span aria-label="78" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg78" role="doc-pagebreak"/>of knowing what was inside those derivatives? Similarly, the engineers coding Alexa-like, cloud-based devices for the purpose of creating automated systems that modify our behaviour are building so much complexity into these systems that they don’t really understand exactly why their systems do what they do.</p>
<p id="tec0000075">It is in our human nature to be vulnerable to anyone, or anything, that seems to understand us better than we do ourselves. In fact, we may be even more vulnerable to algorithms we know to be mindless than we are to real persons, because we are more easily lulled into a false sense of security. We pretend Alexa is a person because we are not used to conversing with machines – the experience would otherwise be embarrassing or uncanny. But the fact that we know Alexa is <em>not</em> a person is how we come to terms with its intense knowledge of us, which would otherwise be offputtingly creepy or scary. At that precise moment, when we relate to it as if it were a person while we know it is not, we are at our most vulnerable – ready to fall into the trap of thinking of Alexa as our own Pandora-like mechanical serf. Alas, Alexa is no serf. It is, rather, a piece of cloud-based command capital which is turning <em>you</em> into a serf, with your aid and by means of your own unpaid labour, in order to further enrich its owners.</p>
<p id="tec0000076">Every time we go online to enjoy the services of these algorithms, we have no option but to cut a Faustian deal with their owners. To use the personalised services their algorithms provide, we must submit to a business model based on the harvesting of our data, the tracking of our activity, the invisible curating of our content. Once we have submitted to this, the algorithm goes into the business of selling things to us while selling our attention to others. At that <span aria-label="79" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg79" role="doc-pagebreak"/>point something more profound kicks in which gives the algorithm’s owners immense power – to predict our behaviours, to guide our preferences, to influence our decisions, to change our minds, to thereby reduce us to their unpaid servants, whose job is to provide our information, our attention, our identity and above all the patterns of behaviour that train their algorithms.</p>
<p id="tec0000077">But is any of this really new? Is cloud capital radically different from other kinds of capital, such as hammers, steam engines or the television networks that Don Draper deployed to manipulate our matrix of desires? It is certainly no less physical than these other kinds of capital, for the cloud metaphor is just that: a metaphor. In reality, it is comprised of vast data warehouses, containing endless rows of servers, connected by a globe-spanning web of sensors and cables. Might cloud capital stand out because of its power to command? That can’t be it either. The story of Mr Peel’s misfortunes in Western Australia established that, since capitalism’s early days, <em>all</em> capital goods have commanding power – some a little more, others a little less.</p>
<p id="tec0000078">No, although cloud capital can command us in unprecedented ways, the key to grasping cloud capital’s special nature, as we shall see, is the way it <em>reproduces</em> itself – and its power to command – a process that is very different to the one that reproduces hammers, steam engines and television networks.</p>
<p id="tec0000079">Here is a glimpse of what makes cloud capital so fundamentally new, different and scary: capital has hitherto been reproduced within some labour market – within the factory, the office, the warehouse. Aided by machines, it was <em>waged workers</em> who produced the stuff that was sold to generate profits, which in turn financed their wages and the production <span aria-label="80" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg80" role="doc-pagebreak"/>of more machines – that’s how capital accumulated and reproduced. Cloud capital, in contrast, can reproduce itself in ways that involve <em>no waged labour</em>. How? By commanding almost the whole of humanity to chip in to its reproduction – for free!</p>
<p id="tec0000080">But first, let us make an important distinction: between the effect of Big Tech on the traditional workplace, where workers’ conditions are more extreme but not in essence any different from those of the millworkers of old, and its effect on the <em>users</em> of technology generally, which creates an essentially new condition altogether. By doing so, we shall see that while workers have become ‘cloud proles’ we all have become ‘cloud serfs’.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000081"><em>Cloud proles</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000082">The technology may be outlandishly new but the way it is deployed to command badly paid workers on the factory floor is almost two centuries old. As they struggle to keep up with computer devices that track and dictate the pace of their every move, Amazon warehouse workers would recognise themselves instantly in Charlie Chaplin’s <em>Modern Times</em> (1936) – one of your favourite movies. Forced to inspect and scan 1,800 Amazon packages an hour is an uncannily similar fate to that of Chaplin’s character on the industrial factory line, who is trying to keep pace with a suddenly accelerating conveyor belt, and who is ultimately driven mad and falls into the vast machine whose cog he could never truly become.</p>
<p id="tec0000083">When Juan Espinoza, a picker at a Staten Island Amazon warehouse, opined that ‘Mr Bezos couldn’t do a full shift at that place as an undercover boss,’ anyone familiar with Fritz <span aria-label="81" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg81" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Lang’s even earlier film <em>Metropolis</em> (1927) would have been reminded of the scene in which Freder, the autocrat’s son, inadvertently descends into his father’s Machine Halls, where workers are engaged in a desperate struggle to keep the massive hands of huge clock-like machines aligned. Shocked at what he finds, Freder holds his head in horror at the sight of machines marching the workers at an inhuman tempo, mechanising them ruthlessly.</p>
<p id="tec0000084">Some years ago, you asked if Big Tech’s new gadgetry had significantly changed the traditional manufacturing process. ‘No,’ I replied, ‘at least not yet.’ As long as humans are still part of a semi-automated production line, performing tasks that the machines cannot, the pace of human workers will be dictated by machines whose priority is to squeeze the last drop of productive energy from their human co-workers.</p>
<p id="tec0000085">Does it matter, I imagine you asking, that in modern factories and warehouses this control is no longer exercised by cogs, wheels, sprockets and belts but by algorithms running on plug-in devices wirelessly connected to the company’s neural network? No, not much. Cloud proles – my term for waged workers driven to their physical limits by cloud-based algorithms – suffer at work in ways that would be instantly recognised by whole generations of earlier proletarians.</p>
<p id="tec0000086">Take Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, which the company describes as a ‘crowdsourcing marketplace that makes it easier for individuals and businesses to outsource their processes and jobs to a distributed workforce who can perform these tasks virtually’. But let us call it what it is: a cloud-based sweatshop where workers are paid piece rates to work virtually. Nothing is happening there that Karl Marx had not fully analysed in the twenty-first chapter of the first volume of his <em>Capital</em>, where he stated: ‘Piece-wages become … the most <span aria-label="82" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg82" role="doc-pagebreak"/>fruitful source of reductions in wages and of frauds committed by the capitalists.’ Precarious piecework, Marx added, is ‘the most appropriate to the capitalist mode of production’. Hear, hear!</p>
<p id="tec0000087">That’s not to say that the ‘algos’ have not cast a long shadow over the factory floor. They have. Algorithms have already replaced bosses in the transport, deliveries and warehousing sectors. And workers forced to work for these algorithms find themselves in a modernist nightmare: some non-corporeal entity that not only lacks but is actually incapable of human empathy allocates them work at a rate of its choosing before monitoring their response times. Released from any of the qualms even inhumane humans harbour, the algo-bosses are at liberty to reduce the workers’ paid hours, to increase their tempo to insanity-inducing levels, or to turn them out onto the street for ‘inefficiency’. At that point, the workers sacked by the algorithm are thrown into a Kafkaesque spiral, unable to speak to a human capable of explaining why they were fired.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter003_en_5" id="chapter003_en5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></p>
<p id="tec0000088">Soon, no doubt, algorithms will develop union-busting capabilities, too. As we speak, dazzling algorithms are mapping out the tens of thousands of molecules in key proteins in superbugs that threaten to kill or debilitate us. Once these proteins are fully decoded, the algorithms proceed – again without human input – to design exotic antibiotics that kill the superbug – a scientific triumph for the ages. What is there to stop a similar algorithm from designing a global supply chain that bypasses warehouses or factories in which trades unions seem likely to succeed in organising workers? Trades unions could be snuffed out before they are even formed.</p>
<p id="tec0000089">So, yes, cloud capital is turning workplaces into <em>Metropolis</em>-like Algo Halls in which human workers are reduced to exhausted cloud proles. And yet, cloud proles are not suffering <span aria-label="83" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg83" role="doc-pagebreak"/>a fate terrestrial proles, of the <em>Modern Times</em> variety, would find surprising. Cloud capital, in short, continues to do in the world’s factories, warehouses and other traditional workplaces that which traditional, terrestrial, capital always did – perhaps a little more efficiently.</p>
<p id="tec0000090">However, <em>outside</em> the traditional places of work, cloud capital is demolishing everything we used to take for granted.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000091"><em>Cloud serfs</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000092">Don Draper is perhaps Romanticism’s last poster boy. He treated science with suspicion and computers with disdain. He idealised nature and loved hitting the road in his gargantuan Cadillac. He lived and breathed individualism. He luxuriated in nostalgia. He adored women until they fell for him – at which point he bolted. He feared emotions because he saw them as the ultimate repository of insights into the human spirit. And he used his talents to commodify this melange of memory, sentiment, fickleness and insight so as to extract from consumers monies they might have otherwise kept for themselves.</p>
<p id="tec0000093">His algorithmic double Alexa may be no romantic but cloud capital monetises our emotions more effectively than Don ever could. It tailor-makes experiences that exploit our biases to drive consumption, and then it uses our responses to hone those experiences yet further. But that’s only the beginning. Besides modifying our consumer behaviour in ways Don Draper would marvel at, and perhaps be appalled by, cloud capital has a far more impressive trick up its sleeve: it can command us to put work <em>directly</em> into its own reproduction, reinforcement and maintenance.</p>
<p id="tec0000094"><span aria-label="84" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg84" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Consider what cloud capital consists of: smart software, server farms, cell towers, thousands of miles of optic fibre. And yet all of this would be worthless without ‘content’. The most valuable part of the stock of cloud capital is not its physical components but rather the stories posted on Facebook, the videos uploaded to TikTok and YouTube, the photos on Instagram, the jokes and insults on Twitter, the reviews on Amazon or, simply, our movement through space, allowing our phones to alert Google Maps to the latest spot of traffic. In providing these stories, videos, photos, jokes and movements, it is we who produce and reproduce – outside any market – the stock of cloud capital.</p>
<p id="tec0000095">This is unparalleled. Workers employed by General Electric, Exxon-Mobil, General Motors or any other major conglomerate collect in salaries and wages approximately 80 per cent of the company’s income. This proportion grows larger in smaller firms. Big Tech’s workers, in contrast, collect less than 1 per cent of their firms’ revenues. The reason is that paid labour performs only a fraction of the work that Big Tech relies on. Most of the work is performed by billions of people for free.</p>
<p id="tec0000096">Sure enough, most of us choose to do this, enjoy it even. Broadcasting our opinions and sharing our lives’ intimate details with our digital tribes and communities seems to satisfy some perverse expressive need of ours. No doubt, under feudalism, serfs toiling away on their ancestral lands would have suffered great hardships but still found it undesirable, if not unfathomable, to have their way of life taken away from them, their shared culture and traditions. Still, the harsh reality remained: at the end of the harvest, the landlord would send the sheriff to extract the lion’s share of their produce – without paying the serfs a penny for it. So it goes with the <span aria-label="85" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg85" role="doc-pagebreak"/>billions of us unwittingly producing cloud capital. The fact that we do so voluntarily, happily even, does not detract from the fact that we are unpaid manufacturers – cloud serfs whose daily self-directed toil enriches a tiny band of multibillionaires residing mostly in California or Shanghai.</p>
<p id="tec0000097">This is the crux. The digital revolution may be turning waged workers into cloud proles, who live increasingly precarious, stressful lives under the invisible thumb of algorithmic bosses. And it may have replaced Don Draper with extraordinary behaviour modification algorithms, hidden behind elegant tabletop appliances like Alexa. But that’s not the most significant fact about cloud capital. Cloud capital’s singular achievement, a feat far superior to either of these, is the way it has revolutionised <em>its own reproduction</em>. The true revolution cloud capital has inflicted on humanity is the conversion of billions of us into willing cloud serfs volunteering to labour for nothing to reproduce cloud capital for the benefit of its owners.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000098"><em>Wither markets, hello cloud fiefs</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000099">‘Enter amazon.com and you have exited capitalism. Despite all the buying and the selling that goes on there, you have entered a realm which can’t be thought of as a market, not even a digital one.’ When I say this to people, which I frequently do in lectures and debates, they look at me as they would a madman. But once I start explaining what I mean, their fear for my sanity soon turns into fear for us all.</p>
<p id="tec0000100">Imagine the following scene straight out of the science-fiction storybook. You are beamed into a town full of people going about their business, trading in gadgets, clothes, shoes, <span aria-label="86" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg86" role="doc-pagebreak"/>books, songs, games and movies. At first, everything looks normal. Until you begin to notice something odd. It turns out that all the shops, indeed every building, belong to a chap called Jeff. He may not own the factories that produce the stuff sold in his shops but he owns an algorithm that takes a cut for each sale and he gets to decide what can be sold and what cannot.</p>
<p id="tec0000101">If that were all, the scene would evoke an old Western in which a lonesome cowboy rides into town to discover that a podgy strongman owns the saloon bar, the grocery store, the post office, the railway, the bank and, naturally, the sheriff. Except that isn’t all. Jeff owns more than the shops and the public buildings. He also owns the dirt you walk on, the bench you sit on, even the air you breathe. In fact, in this weird town everything you see (and don’t see) is regulated by Jeff’s algorithm: you and I may be walking next to each other, our eyes trained in the same direction, but the view provided to us by the algorithm is entirely bespoke, carefully curated according to Jeff’s priorities. Everyone navigating their way around amazon.com – except Jeff – is wandering in algorithmically constructed isolation.</p>
<p id="tec0000102">This is no market town. It is not even some form of hyper-capitalist digital market. Even the ugliest of markets are meeting places where people can interact and exchange information reasonably freely. In fact, it’s even worse than a totally monopolised market – there, at least, the buyers can talk to each other, form associations, perhaps organise a consumer boycott to force the monopolist to reduce a price or to improve a quality. Not so in Jeff’s realm, where everything and everyone is intermediated not by the disinterested invisible hand of the market but by an algorithm that works for Jeff’s bottom line and dances exclusively to his tune.</p>
<p id="tec0000103"><span aria-label="87" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg87" role="doc-pagebreak"/>If this is not scary enough, recall that it is the same algorithm which, via Alexa, has trained us to train it to manufacture our desires. The mind rebels at the enormity of the hubris. The same algorithm that we help train in real time to know us inside out, both modifies our preferences and administers the selection and delivery of commodities that will satisfy these preferences. It is as if Don Draper could not only implant in us desires for specific products but had attained the superpower instantly to deliver said products to our doorstep, bypassing any potential competitor, all in the interest of bolstering the wealth and power of a chap called Jeff.</p>
<p id="tec0000104">Such concentrated power should scare the living daylights out of the liberally minded. Anyone committed to the idea of the market (not to mention the autonomous self) should recognise that cloud capital is its death knell. It should also shake market sceptics, socialists in particular, out of the complacent assumption that amazon.com is bad because it is a capitalist market gone berserk. Actually, it’s something worse than that.</p>
<p id="tec0000105">‘If it ain’t a capitalist market, what in the sweet Lord’s name are we stepping into when we enter amazon.com?’ a student at the University of Texas asked me a few years ago.</p>
<p id="tec0000106">‘A type of digital fief,’ I replied instinctively. ‘A post-capitalist one, whose historical roots remain in feudal Europe but whose integrity is maintained today by a futuristic, dystopian type of cloud-based capital.’ Since then, I have come to believe that it was a reasonably accurate answer to a hard question.</p>
<p id="tec0000107">Under feudalism, the overlord would grant so-called fiefs to subordinates called vassals. These fiefs gave the vassals the formal right to exploit economically a part of the overlord’s realm – to plant crops on it, for example, or graze <span aria-label="88" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg88" role="doc-pagebreak"/>cattle – in exchange for a portion of the produce. The overlord would then unleash his sheriff to police the fief’s execution and collect what he was owed. Jeff’s relationship with the vendors on amazon.com is not too dissimilar. He grants them cloud-based digital fiefs, for a fee, and then leaves his algo-sheriff to police and collect.</p>
<p id="tec0000108">Amazon was just the start. Alibaba applied the same techniques to create a similar cloud fief in China. Copycat ecommerce platforms, offering variations on the Amazon theme, are springing up everywhere, in the Global South as well as the Global North. More significantly, other industrial sectors are turning into cloud fiefs too. Take for example Tesla, Elon Musk’s successful electric car company. One reason financiers value it so much higher than Ford or Toyota is that its cars’ every circuit is wired into cloud capital. Besides giving Tesla the power to switch off one of its cars remotely, if for instance the driver fails to service it as the company wishes, merely by driving around Tesla owners are uploading in real time information (including what music they are listening to!) that enriches the company’s cloud capital. They may not think of themselves as cloud serfs but, alas, that’s precisely what the proud owners of new, wonderfully aerodynamically gleaming Teslas are.</p>
<p id="tec0000109">It took mind-bending scientific breakthroughs, fantastical-sounding neural networks and imagination-defying AI programs to accomplish what? To turn workers toiling in warehouses, driving cabs and delivering food into cloud proles. To create a world where markets are increasingly replaced by cloud fiefs. To force businesses into the role of vassals. And to turn all of us into cloud serfs, glued to our smartphones and tablets, eagerly producing the cloud capital that keeps our new overlords on cloud nine.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000110"><em><span aria-label="89" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg89" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Back to your question</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000111">If I had to name one thing I learned from you, it would be the ability to relish contradictions.</p>
<p class="noindent_topspace" id="tec0000112">You worshipped iron, but were moved to tears by Hesiod’s tirades against the Iron Age. You threw your lot in with the communists, knowing full well that, if your side won, you would end up in the gulag. You fell in love with every furnace, pipe, conveyor belt and crane in the steel factory where you worked, but remained horrified by their tendency to mechanise, alienate and dehumanise the workers appended to them.</p>
<p id="tec0000113">It is why I wanted to talk to you about cloud capital. Because you would know how to admire and detest it at once. And because, through this contradiction, you would recognise that cloud capital is the key to answering your question about the internet’s impact on capitalism.</p>
<p id="tec0000114">Capitalism surfaced when owners of capital goods (steam engines, machine tools, spinning jennies, telegraph poles, etc.) acquired the power to command people and nations – powers that far exceeded, for the first time, those of landowners. It was a Great Transformation made possible by the prior privatisation of common lands. Same with cloud capital. To acquire its even greater powers to command, it too required the prior privatisation of another crucial commons: Internet One.</p>
<p id="tec0000115">Like all capital since capitalism’s inception, cloud capital can be thought of as a vast production and behaviour-modification machine: it produces marvellous devices <em>and</em> the power (for its owners) to command humans who do not <span aria-label="90" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg90" role="doc-pagebreak"/>own it. But that’s where the similarity between terrestrial and cloud capital ends and where the difference between conventional capitalists and cloudalists begins.</p>
<p id="tec0000116">Previously, to exercise capital’s power to command and make other humans <em>work faster</em> and <em>consume more</em>, capitalists required two types of professionals: managers and marketeers. Especially under the auspices of the post-war technostructure, these two service professions achieved greater prominence even than bankers and insurance brokers. Gleaming new business schools were set up to initiate MBA students in the dark arts of quick-marching a workforce towards explosive labour productivity. Advertising and marketing departments nurtured a generation of Don Drapers.</p>
<p id="tec0000117">Then, cloud capital arrived. At one fell swoop it automated both roles. The exercise of capital’s power to command workers and consumers alike was handed over to the algos. This was a far more revolutionary step than replacing autoworkers with industrial robots. After all, industrial robots simply do what automation has been doing since before the Luddites: making proletarians redundant, or more miserable, or both. No, the truly historic disruption was to automate capital’s power to command people <em>outside</em> the factory, the shop or the office – to turn all of us, cloud proles and everyone else, into cloud serfs in the direct (unremunerated) service of cloud capital, unmediated by any market.</p>
<p id="tec0000118">Meanwhile, conventional capitalist manufacturers increasingly have no option but to sell their goods at the discretion of the cloudalists, paying them a fee for the privilege, developing a relationship with them no different to that of vassals vis-à-vis their feudal overlords.</p>
<p id="tec0000119">So, back to your question: ‘Now that computers speak to each other, will this network make capitalism impossible to <span aria-label="91" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg91" role="doc-pagebreak"/>overthrow? Or might it finally reveal its Achilles heel?’ On the one hand, the rise of cloud capital has solidified, augmented and massively expanded capital’s triumph over labour, society and, catastrophically, nature. And yet, here is the contradiction: in doing so, cloud capital has simultaneously ushered in the technofeudal system that has killed capitalism in so many realms and is in the process of replacing it everywhere else.</p>
<p id="tec0000120">In your youth, you dreamed of a time when labour would shake off the yoke of the capitalist market. So did I. Alas, something more like the opposite happened: it is capital that has shaken off the yoke of the capitalist market! And while capital is taking its victory lap, capitalism itself is receding. A sophism to sweeten the pill of our defeat? Not so – as I intend to show in <a href="chapter005.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>. For now, however, let us address perhaps the most surprising and compelling aspect of capitalism’s demise: the story of how the cloudalists pulled off this astonishing feat and how, for them, profit, once the driving force of our capitalist economies, became … optional.</p>
