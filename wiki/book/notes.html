Producers produced freely, engaged freely with buyers who also associated freely with each other – while the company stood back, promoted none of the products on sale <span aria-label="245" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg245" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and simply got a cut from every sale (the one aspect of the set-up that a rent-hating, purist libertarian would have detested). In sharp contrast, on trading sites like Amazon or Alibaba buyers and sellers enjoy none of these freedoms to associate, to even see the same things, while online – the algorithm instead banning buyers and sellers from autonomous communications with one another and selecting itself what each one of them can, and cannot, see or do.</p></aside>
<aside epub:type="endnote" id="chapter004_en_4"><p id="seq_19"><a class="backlink" href="chapter004.xhtml#chapter004_en4" role="doc-backlink">4</a> The European Union proved the most enthusiastic champion of austerity, followed at some distance by two different UK governments that also imposed self-defeating austerity – especially that of Cameron and Osborne after 2010. Meanwhile in the United States, though President Obama made a big deal out of his stimulus programme, the reality begged to differ: not only was his federal stimulus too small in relation to the drop in demand for goods, services and labour, but, more pertinently, it was cancelled out by massive expenditure cuts at the level of states whose income had collapsed (primarily because of the massive fall in real estate prices).</p></aside>
<aside epub:type="endnote" id="chapter004_en_5"><p id="seq_20"><a class="backlink" href="chapter004.xhtml#chapter004_en5" role="doc-backlink">5</a> Note that it was no aberration. Between 2009 and 2022, the official interest rates stayed negative in the eurozone, Scandinavia, Switzerland, Norway and Japan. And it was not just the official rate. During that period loans amounting to more than $18 trillion (which was more the total annual income of Europe and Japan) paid lenders negative interest rates.</p></aside>
<aside epub:type="endnote" id="chapter004_en_6"><p id="seq_21"><a class="backlink" href="chapter004.xhtml#chapter004_en6" role="doc-backlink">6</a> Bank bailouts do not need to be as corrupt as those following the crash of 2008. In 1992 Scandinavian banks failed and states stepped in to save them. But they did not save the bankers. Instead, they kicked them out, nationalised the banks, appointed new directors and, years later, sold them to new owners. Similarly in South Korea after the 1998 South East Asian banking crisis. In contrast, after 2008 in the United <span aria-label="246" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg246" role="doc-pagebreak"/>States and Europe, with the exception of Lehman Brothers, the central banks saved the bankrupt bankers, prompting me to coin the term ‘bankruptocracy’ – the new, post-2008, reality where a Western banker’s power is analogous to the size of his bank’s losses! See my <em>The Global Minotaur</em>, Zed Books, 2011.</p></aside>
<aside epub:type="endnote" id="chapter004_en_7"><p id="seq_22"><a class="backlink" href="chapter004.xhtml#chapter004_en7" role="doc-backlink">7</a> How does the central bank do this in practice? You and I cannot have an account with our central bank. Only bankers can. All the central bank (like the Bank of England or the Fed) needs to do is to authorise an overdraft by typing in a sum in the account that a private bank (like Barclays or Bank of America) keeps at its central bank. Legally, for this to happen, the private bank must post collateral, in the form of monies owed to it by government (bonds) or privateers (mortgages, credit card debt, private bonds). But during times of financial stress, when everyone owes to everyone else and no one can pay, the central bank accepts collateral not even worth the paper it was written on.</p></aside>

So, they explained, to ‘restore confidence’ and ‘stimulate investment’ they had no choice but to send torrents of cash the bankers’ way. The situation was so bad, they told the public, that the central bank was compelled to hand money to banks to pass it on to businesses to invest.</p></aside>

It was strange but understandable: because most of us were locked down, demand for petrol and diesel oil buckled. Suddenly oil reservoirs overflowed and their owners, who had long-term obligations to buy certain quantities of oil every week independently of demand for oil, were forced to pay people to take that excess oil away.</p></aside>

However, I also made the point that it was the combination of money printing on behalf of the bankers and austerity for the many that poisoned money – not just the money printing. It fascinates me that mainstream commentators keep quiet about the austerity part (clearly because they agree with it) and concentrate their arrows at central bankers for printing money. What they neglect to tell us is what they would have done differently after 2008. Would they agree with the only alternative to what the central bankers actually did, i.e. annulling unpayable (public and private) debts, nationalising failed banks, and printing money to fund a basic income that lifts all boats at once during the Great Recession? Of course they wouldn’t. Thus, their anti-central bank philippics are the epitome of hypocrisy.</p></aside>

This sharp and brief crisis spelled the end of the shortest tenure of any British prime minister – that of Liz Truss, who had just announced the intention to add considerably to the UK’s debt on behalf of Britain’s richest. The reason the bottom fell from the UK’s bond (or gilt) market, in response to Truss’s announcement, was a landmine buried in the City during the years of socialism-for-the-bankers: the derivatives UK pension funds had massively invested in, to hedge against inflation and higher interest rates – derivatives they could not afford except by borrowing against their stock of UK government gilts. So, when the news came in that Truss was planning to issue more gilts to pay for large tax cuts, without frontloading austerity, the price of gilts fell and, suddenly, pension funds had to post more cash to cover the debt they had incurred to buy the derivatives. In a state of panic, they sold the only liquid asset they had: gilts! And so the doom-loop began until the Bank of England intervened and Liz Truss left 10 Downing Street in disgrace.</p></aside>

Meanwhile, the higher American net imports pushed the Chinese capitalists’ <span aria-label="250" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg250" role="doc-pagebreak"/>dollar profits, which were then re-exported back to the US, the less the total income left within the Chinese economy for the masses that produced it.</p></aside>

When the eurozone’s weaker economies begin to topple like dominoes (first Greece, then Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Cyprus, etc.), German manufacturing exports were diverted from those fallen markets to China – where demand was kept high by China’s immense investment expenditures, e.g. the thousands of miles of ultra-fast railway lines that were constructed in less than three years.</p></aside>

The agreement’s stated purpose was to devalue the US dollar in an attempt to rein in the Minotaur: to contain America’s trade deficit. While the Plaza Accord did succeed in devaluing the dollar vis-à-vis the yen by more than 50% (within two years of its signing), the Accord’s real purpose was subtler: the aim was, at least in part, <em>to prevent Japan from becoming a rentier nation</em> in opposition to US rentier capitalism. As the yen climbed, the Japanese economy went into a sustained slowdown. In response, Japan’s central bank pumped a lot of new money into Japan’s banks, causing massive bubbles to build up in real estate. When in the early 1990s the authorities tried to deflate that bubble, by increasing interest rates, house and office prices crashed. The nation’s banks ended up with huge loans on their books that no one could repay. For the first time since the mid-1930s, an advanced capitalist economy had been caught in a recessionary <em>liquidity trap</em> – a precursor to what happened after 2008 across the West. Then, Japan’s central bank inaugurated the policy of industrial-scale money-printing (euphemistically called ‘quantitative easing’) which, after 2008, was adopted by every one of the West’s central banks.</p></aside>

Consequently, the exchange value of each unit of output follows a path of secular decline. Inevitably, the profit rate must follow suit – downwards!</p></aside>

Its origins are to be found in mass multi-player video games where systems of quasi-payments were developed before spreading to many digital platforms or cloud fiefs. Initially, gamers’ own behaviour breathed spontaneously exchange value into certain relative scarce digital artefacts within their gaming environment (e.g. a particular sword or helmet). Soon, they were rewarded by the corporation behind the game with coveted digital items – the first inklings of the NFTs that became all the rage outside the gaming communities in 2020. Later, corporations found ways to ‘gamify’ work that added to their cloud capital. Like Amazon preferring to refer to its workers as ‘associates’, these workers are not called workers but, instead, ‘players’, ‘users’, ‘taskers’, etc. To keep them working hard on its behalf, cloud capital (e.g. Mechanical Turk, Amazon’s cloud sweatshop, where workers in 2020 made less than $2 per hour while 90 per cent of tasks paid less than $0.10 per task) uses a plethora of non-monetary, token-based payments and, crucially, on-screen rankings in order to motivate almost Stakhanovite levels of competition between workers.</p></aside>
