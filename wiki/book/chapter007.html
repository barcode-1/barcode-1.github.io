<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000366">It felt like hours before the artist finally appeared. Awaiting him onstage was a shiny, oversized, robotic-looking metal exoskeleton suspended by a long cable from the high ceiling of the art space – a converted former power station just outside of Sydney. I was among the audience in the dimly lit turbine room, increasingly captivated by the wafting soundtrack and mesmerised by the elegantly glistening machine. The calendar read 19 August 2000 – a good four years before Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook, six years before the first tweet, and only a year since the first search on Google. The internet was still in its Age of Innocence, and the dream of it as an open digital forum for, and governed by, sovereign participants was still alive.</p>
<p id="tec0000367">At last Stelarc, the artist, emerged.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_1" id="chapter007_en1" role="doc-noteref">1</a> Once inside the exoskeleton, Stelarc would continue to be free to move his legs as he wished, but his arms would be controlled remotely by an anonymous crowd watching and participating via the internet. Stelarc climbed into the machine, which he had named Movatar, and the system began to boot up. Soon enough, it connected to the internet where the invisible strangers awaited. Unlike a dancer who captivates you with the effortlessness of their movement, Movatar was compelling for its awkwardness. Its upper body moved jerkily, as if in opposition to the legs beneath. Its clumsy movements were strangely moving, brimming with significance – but signifying what exactly? I sensed a window opening onto the <span aria-label="176" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg176" role="doc-pagebreak"/>relationship between humans and their technologies, and the same contradictions that had inspired Hesiod.</p>
<p id="tec0000368">Afterwards, I remember thinking about your question: was the internet capitalism’s friend or foe? Was Movatar part of the answer? And what did it mean for the human condition? Back then, I hadn’t a clue. But today, I see it clearly: Stelarc’s Movatar prophesied what was to happen to us when traditional capital evolved into cloud capital, from a ‘produced means of production’ into a produced means of <em>behaviour modification</em>. Stelarc was merely experimenting with the idea of the post-human, but his Movatar captured the essence of humanity’s future reality. As I see it now, Movatar was a creature at the mercy of hyper-connected, algorithmically driven, cloud-based capital. Another name for it would be <em>Homo technofeudalis</em>.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000369"><em>The death of the liberal individual</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000370">To this day, I envy the way you lived, Dad. You were the epitome of the liberal individual. Sure, to make a living, you had reluctantly to lease yourself to your boss at the steel plant in Eleusis. But during your lunch break you wandered blissfully in the open-air backyard of the Eleusis Archaeological Museum, where you luxuriated in the discovery of ancient steles full of clues that antiquity’s technologists were more advanced than previously thought. And following your return home, at just after five every afternoon, and a late siesta, you emerged ready to share in our family life and, on some nights, when we weren’t messing about with various metals by our fireplace, to write your books and papers. Your life at the factory was, in short, neatly ring-fenced from your personal life.</p>
<p id="tec0000371"><span aria-label="177" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg177" role="doc-pagebreak"/>It reflected a time when we thought that, if nothing else, capitalism had granted us sovereignty over our selves, albeit within certain limited parameters. However hard one had to work, you could at least fence off a portion of your life, however small, and within that fence remain autonomous, self-determining, free. Leftists, like us, knew that only the rich were truly free to choose, that the poor were mostly free to lose, and that the worst slavery was that of those who had learned to love their chains.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_2" id="chapter007_en2" role="doc-noteref">2</a> Still, even we, capitalism’s harshest critics, appreciated the limited self-ownership it granted us.</p>
<p id="tec0000372">For young people in today’s world, even this small mercy has been taken away. Curating an identity online is not optional, and so their personal lives have become some of the most important work they do. From the moment they take their first steps online, they suffer like Movatar from two perplexingly contradictory demands: they are taught implicitly to see themselves as a brand, yet one that will be judged according to its perceived authenticity. (And that includes potential employers: ‘No one will offer me a job,’ a graduate told me once, ‘until I have discovered my true self.’) And so before posting any image, uploading any video, reviewing any movie, sharing any photograph or message, they must be mindful of who their choice will please or alienate. They must somehow work out which of their potential ‘true selves’ will be found most attractive, continually testing their own opinions against their notion of what the average opinion among online opinion makers might be.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_3" id="chapter007_en3" role="doc-noteref">3</a> Every experience can be captured and shared, and so they are continually consumed by the question of whether to do so. And even if no opportunity actually exists for sharing the experience, that opportunity can readily be imagined, and will be. Every <span aria-label="178" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg178" role="doc-pagebreak"/>choice, witnessed or otherwise, becomes an act in the curation of an identity.</p>
<p id="tec0000373">One need not be a radical critic of our society to see that the right to a bit of time each day when one is not for sale has all but vanished. The irony is that the liberal individual was snuffed out neither by fascist Brownshirts nor by Stalinist guards. It was killed off when a new form of capital began to instruct youngsters to do that most liberal of things: be yourself! (And be successful at it!) Of all the behavioural modifications that cloud capital has engineered and monetised, this one is surely its overarching and crowning achievement.</p>
<p id="tec0000374">Possessive individualism has always been detrimental to mental health. Technofeudalism made things infinitely worse when it demolished the fence that used to provide the liberal individual with a refuge from the market. Cloud capital has shattered the individual into fragments of data, an identity comprised of choices as expressed by clicks, which its algorithms are able to manipulate. It has produced individuals who are not so much possessive as <em>possessed</em>, or rather persons incapable of being self-possessed. It has diminished our capacity to focus by co-opting our attention. We have not become weak-willed. No, our focus has been stolen.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_4" id="chapter007_en4" role="doc-noteref">4</a> And because technofeudalism’s algorithms are known to reinforce patriarchy, stereotypes and pre-existing oppressions, those who are most vulnerable – girls, the mentally ill, the marginalised and, yes, the poor – suffer the outcome most.</p>
<p id="tec0000375">If fascism taught us anything, it is our susceptibility to demonising stereotypes and the ugly attraction of emotions like righteousness, fear, envy and loathing that they arouse in us. In our technofeudal world, the internet brings the feared and loathed ‘other’ closer, right in your face. And because online violence seems bloodless and anodyne, we are more <span aria-label="179" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg179" role="doc-pagebreak"/>likely to respond to this ‘other’ online with taunting, inhuman language and bile. Bigotry is technofeudalism’s emotional compensation for the frustrations and anxieties we experience in relation to identity and focus. Comment moderators and hate-speech regulation can’t stop this because it is intrinsic to cloud capital, whose algorithms optimise for cloud rents, which flow more copiously from hatred and discontent.</p>
<p id="tec0000376">You once told me that finding something timelessly beautiful to focus on, as you did by choosing to lose yourself among the relics of ancient Greece, is our only defence from the demons circling our soul. I have tried to practise this over the years in my own way. But in the face of technofeudalism, acting alone, isolated, as liberal individuals will not get us very far. Cutting ourselves off from the internet, switching off our phones, using cash instead of plastic may help for a while but they are no solution. Unless we band together, we shall never civilise or socialise cloud capital, and so we shall never reclaim our own minds from its grip.</p>
<p id="tec0000377">And herein lies the greatest contradiction: to rescue that foundational liberal idea – of liberty as self-ownership – will therefore require a comprehensive reconfiguration of property rights over the increasingly cloud-based instruments of production, distribution, collaboration and communication. To resuscitate the liberal individual, we need to do something that liberals detest: plan a new revolution.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000378"><em>The impossibility of social democracy</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000379">Why can’t technofeudalism be tamed by politics in the same way capitalism was restrained, at least for a while, by social democratic governments?</p>
<p id="tec0000380"><span aria-label="180" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg180" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Social democrats were able to make a difference during a time when power was vested in old-fashioned industrial capital. They acted as referees between organised labour and the captains of manufacturing industry, metaphorically (and occasionally literally) sitting them around a table, forcing them to compromise. The result was, on the one hand, improved wages and conditions for the workers and, on the other hand, the diversion of a chunk of industry’s profits to pensions, hospitals, schools, unemployment insurance and the arts. But as power shifted from industry to finance after the death of Bretton Woods in 1971, European social democrats and American Democrats alike were lured into a Faustian bargain with the bankers of Wall Street, the City of London, Frankfurt and Paris. The bargain was crude and simple: social democrats in government freed bankers from the shackles of regulation: ‘Go crazy! Regulate yourselves,’ they told them. In return, financiers agreed to hand over the crumbs from their substantial table, in the form of a small portion of their gargantuan gains from rabid financialisation, to fund the welfare state.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_5" id="chapter007_en5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></p>
<p id="tec0000381">In Homeric terms, the social democrats had become the era’s lotus eaters. As they gorged themselves on financialisation, they became intellectually soft and morally complicit in its practices. Its honeyed juice lulled them into the belief that what had once been risky was now riskless, that this magic goose would always lay golden eggs, and if those eggs could be used to finance the welfare state, then whatever else the goose did could be justified. And so, when in 2008 financial capital came crashing down, they lacked both the mental tools and the moral values to tell the bankers: ‘Enough! We may save the banks but not you.’ Hence, the lethal combination of socialism-for-bankers and austerity-for-almost-everyone-<span aria-label="181" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg181" role="doc-pagebreak"/>else, described in <a href="chapter004.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, that stagnated our economies while funding the rise of the cloudalists.</p>
<p id="tec0000382">In the old days, social democrats had a degree of power over the industrialists because they had the backing of the trades unions and could threaten painful regulation. Today, cloudalists do not fear powerful unions because cloud proles are too weak to form them and cloud serfs do not even consider themselves producers. As for regulation, that has worked by putting a lid on prices or by breaking up cartels. In the Age of Cloud Capital, cloudalists feel safe in the thought that neither makes any sense. Price regulation is irrelevant when the services that consumers need to be protected from are either free or the cheapest on the market already.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_6" id="chapter007_en6" role="doc-noteref">6</a> As for breaking them up, as President Theodore Roosevelt did to Rockefeller when he broke up Standard Oil and other cartels, that was only possible in the old days of terrestrial capital. Standard Oil comprised petrol stations, refineries and fuel transport systems strewn all over North America. Breaking it up into regional oil companies, and encouraging these to compete with one another, was politically hard but technically dead easy. But how does one break up Amazon, Facebook, PayPal or, indeed, Tesla today?</p>
<p id="tec0000383">Cloudalists know they can destroy any third-party developer (i.e. vassal capitalist), eking out a living on their cloud fief, who dares to contact one of their users (i.e. cloud serfs) without first paying a cloud rent.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_7" id="chapter007_en7" role="doc-noteref">7</a> They know they can treat their users however they like – when did anyone last decline the terms and conditions of a software update? – because of the hostages they are holding: our contacts, friends, chat histories, photos, music, videos, all of which we lose if we switch to a competing cloud fief. And they know that there is little that government can do to stop them. Unlike national <span aria-label="182" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg182" role="doc-pagebreak"/>phone companies, which our national governments forced to charge the same rates when calling customers of competing companies, how can they force Twitter to share the backlog of all your tweets, photos and videos with, say, Mastodon?<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_8" id="chapter007_en8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></p>
<p id="tec0000384">Even worse, they see that the ideological tide favours them. When you were still a young man, the political left maintained a belief in objective truth and a commitment to constructing new institutions in the service of redistributing incomes, wealth and power for the higher purpose of improving the human condition. Marxists, like yourself, went even further, arguing for revolution because they were convinced by the righteousness of their ethical code, the scientific foundation of their social theory, not to mention the belief that they were working towards a desirable end of history – a luxurious liberal communism in which all systemic exploitation and conflict has vanished. Even though the social democrats increasingly distanced themselves from, and denigrated, the Marxist perspective, much of what they accomplished drew strength from those Marxist convictions. The social democratic agenda was presented as a way to achieve the same things the Marxists advocated – such as universal health care and free education – but without ditching markets, capitalism and, importantly, without the drabness of Soviet communism, the secret police, the gulag.</p>
<p id="tec0000385">From today’s vantage point, it is fascinating to recall that to counter the left’s conviction it was the political right back then which embraced a form of relativism, cautioning against the moral certainties of social democrats, anti-Vietnam War demonstrators, civil rights campaigners, feminists, and arguing that things are more complicated, less black and white, than the unwashed hippies and their older communistic <span aria-label="183" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg183" role="doc-pagebreak"/>fellow travellers assumed. But once the red flag was lowered over the Kremlin in 1991, signalling the defeat of the global left, the tables turned entirely. Suddenly, it was the right that embraced unalloyed truths and non-negotiable virtues: the same reactionaries who had questioned that all peoples had a universal right to statehood or democracy became converts to their imposition (albeit selectively) at gunpoint.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_9" id="chapter007_en9" role="doc-noteref">9</a> The right presented its own new take on the ‘end of history’: not socialism, ushering in shared property and radical equality, but liberal democracy, free markets and possessive individualism. Meanwhile, the left obliged the right by abandoning all certainty and embracing the relativism that the right had just shed: the principle that we all have the right to be free from the extractive power of others transmuted into the principle that no one perspective is worth more than any other.</p>
<p id="tec0000386">Underlying this transformation of the left was, of course, the West’s de-industrialisation, which fragmented the labouring classes, a process that technofeudalism continues to this day. When the working class was still relatively homogenous, a relatively solid class consciousness allowed it to put at least a degree of pressure on social democratic governments. Today, class struggle has been replaced by so-called ‘identity politics’. Tragically, the drive to protect racial, sexual, ethnic and religious minorities and for reparative justice suits just fine people in power who like to appear socially liberal. They enthusiastically embed those causes in their language as long as they only pay lip service to them and do little of substance to protect minorities from the systemic causes of their oppression. Moreover, this discursive espousal of identity politics allows people in authority to do nothing about the economic and political extractive power that is increasingly intertwined with cloud capital. As for the alt-right, nothing <span aria-label="184" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg184" role="doc-pagebreak"/>could have pleased them more. They recognise in identity politics a golden opportunity to capitalise on the in-group, defensive, tribal and racist feelings it arouses in white voters.</p>
<p id="tec0000387">On this new political stage, social democracy is impossible. We no longer have capital on the one side and labour on the other, allowing a social democratic government to play referee and force the two sides into a compromise. Instead we have a centre and an alt-right both in thrall to a new ruling class, the cloudalists, whose rise to power they have enabled, while the left is preoccupied with a civil war on the definition of ‘woman’, on the hierarchy of oppressions and all the rest. Meanwhile, no one speaks for the cloud proles, the cloud serfs, the vassal capitalists, what is left of the traditional proletariat-precariat, the victims of climate change, the masses that technofeudalism stifles and imprisons in its cloud fiefs.</p>
<p id="tec0000388">To revive the original idea of social democracy, and indeed of the liberal individual, two things are essential. First, we must discard the myth that the old left–right distinction is obsolete. As long as we live in an Empire of Capital that rules over, and ruthlessly exploits, humans and the planet, there can be no democratic politics that is not rooted in a leftist agenda of overthrowing it. Second, we must fundamentally reconfigure what that means and how it can be achieved in the world of technofeudalism, where that empire is built on cloud capital, with all of the new, fiendishly complex class structures and conflicts that it engenders.</p>
<p id="tec0000389">If this sounds hard and complicated, let me offer a simpler formulation. After the war, Marxism confidently offered a threatening Truth, the angst-ridden right went relativist, and social democracy got its chance. Following Marxism’s great <span aria-label="185" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg185" role="doc-pagebreak"/>defeat in 1991, Marxist Truth perished, Liberal Truth made a comeback, and social democracy died. After capitalism’s 2008 Waterloo and the rise of technofeudalism, liberals, social democrats and the alt-right are fighting over whatever scraps of power the cloudalists will let them have. Today, our future depends on recovering the confidence to unveil a Truth consistent with our technofeudal condition. It will not be sufficient. But it is necessary.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000390"><em>Crypto’s false promise</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000391">Thomas More wrote his eponymous <em>Utopia</em> in the sixteenth century as a thought experiment in how to cure the evils of the feudal order (in which, it must be said, he played a prominent part). Half a century later, Tommaso Campanella published his own Utopia, <em>The City of the Sun</em>, as a polemic against the prominent Aristotelian view that anyone doing manual labour should be denied full citizenship. He counter-argued that it was the artisans and the builders, not the parasitic feudal classes, who ought to have political power. Today’s evangelical advocates of crypto technologies – with their faith that Wall Street, cloudalists, governments, the deep state, the entire technofeudal order can be brought down by smart computer code and unhackable proof-of-work algorithms – are today’s economic utopians, and crypto is as much a reaction to technofeudalism as the original Utopia was a reaction to feudalism.</p>
<p id="tec0000392">Truth be told, when I first encountered the original paper heralding crypto’s arrival, a 2008 blogpost signed by the now infamous and elusive Satoshi Nakamoto,<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_10" id="chapter007_en10" role="doc-noteref">10</a> I was mesmerised. It began with the sentence: ‘Commerce on the Internet <span aria-label="186" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg186" role="doc-pagebreak"/>has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments.’ It then proceeded to present an algorithm that would allow us to transact with one another online bypassing every financial institution ever created. It was not hard to see the enormity of the claim and the potential emancipation it offered from the parasites of the financial sector – private and state-owned.</p>
<p id="tec0000393">To appreciate crypto’s attraction, consider what happens when you use your debit card to buy a train ticket from London to Brighton using a service like trainline.com that charges you a small cloud rent, say 75p.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_11" id="chapter007_en11" role="doc-noteref">11</a> Where does it go? From the trainline app, your 75p is uploaded to another company, Trainline Holdings Limited, which owns the trainline app. But this company is owned by another which is owned by another, and another, and another. As your 75p shifts from one shell company to another, it travels from London to Jersey to Luxembourg, it is validated by a number of central banks, until it reaches some balmy tax haven. Eventually, it joins a global torrent of dollarised financial capital that no government, no parliament, no demos, no human mind can track, let alone regulate.</p>
<p id="tec0000394">Now, compare this to a crypto transaction of the kind Nakamoto’s paper heralded. You sit in front of your computer. You need no bank account, no plastic card, no social security number to identify yourself with, not even an email account. You just need a private key in the form of a sequence of seemingly random characters that you generated earlier through a few simple automated cryptographic steps. This private key is all you need to make a payment, send money to a good cause, even vote on an online survey or referendum.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_12" id="chapter007_en12" role="doc-noteref">12</a> In essence, your private key is an address, a bank account and <span aria-label="187" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg187" role="doc-pagebreak"/>a social security number all rolled up in one string of characters that lives only on your computer and is known exclusively to you. However, the moment you use it to transact, it is transmitted to a global network of computers belonging to people like yourself. For a transaction to work, it needs to be verified and recorded, in the same way your bank verifies that you have the cash and that, once you have spent, you cannot spend it again. The difference is that, instead of entrusting the verification of your transaction to a bank or to some other parasitic capitalist institution, the verification is performed automatically by computers, like yours, comprising that common network.</p>
<p id="tec0000395">These machines work together to verify your transaction. They do this by competing with each other to solve arbitrary mathematical puzzles, whose purpose is to offer incentives to owners of the fastest computers to help verify your transaction. The machine that wins this contest wins the privilege of adding, or recording, your transaction as a ‘block’ on a long record – known as a blockchain – of every transaction made within this network. In return for that privilege, the winning machine – and its owner – is rewarded with a proof-of-work token, a small payment that can be used on the network for future transactions.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_13" id="chapter007_en13" role="doc-noteref">13</a></p>
<p id="tec0000396">You can see the lure of crypto: in contrast to the madness that begins the moment you pay for anything using a bank-issued card, the blockchain-based transaction seems like democracy-in-action. No one takes a cut. No bank or corporation is involved. No state monitors your transaction. No cloudalist retains a record of what you bought, when and from whom. No crazy path is taken via dozens of intermediaries, contributing at each stage to the accumulation of capital among financiers. Moreover, no one owns the network <span aria-label="188" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg188" role="doc-pagebreak"/>of machines that helped complete your transaction and, therefore, no investors are watching, checking that the pie is growing and their cut of the cloud rents along with it, ready to pull their support the moment confidence in the enterprise begins to wane – not least because this cloud-based network generates <em>no</em> cloud rents.</p>
<p id="tec0000397">Crypto’s birth in 2008 could not have been timed better. In the year that capitalist finance almost died of its own hubris, Bitcoin inspired a wide spectrum of people seeking alternatives: sworn libertarians, the anarchists and socialists who made up the Occupy Wall Street movement, the so-called cypherpunks – a medley of cryptographers and coders who had been worrying about privacy since the 1980s. But soon cracks began to appear, and it was the libertarian faction of the crypto movement who ultimately gained the upper hand. For them, enemy number one had always been the central banks, which they portrayed as a sort of Catholic Church, insisting on acting as intermediary between humans and their sacred profits, with themselves in the role of a latter-day Martin Luther pushing for a Protestant Reformation. Thus, the crypto movement which had also initially attracted anarchists and socialists, became a supremely volatile currency market, in which anyone sufficiently expert in the new blockchain technology issued their own ‘coins’ whose dollar value they tried to boost before cashing in. Their ideological contempt for fiat, or state-created, money turned out to be a ruse for issuing their own fiat money. By the time, in 2017, one Bitcoin traded for more than $20,000, the early emancipatory promise of crypto had vanished.</p>
<p id="tec0000398">Using similar blockchain methods, model Kate Moss sold a digital photo of herself in the form of a Bitcoin-like string of characters for more than $17,000. Jack Dorsey, then <span aria-label="189" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg189" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Twitter’s chief, raised the stakes by selling code linked to an image of the first ever tweet for $2.9 million. To top the madness, Mike Winkelmann, an artist known as Beeple, managed to sell at a Christie’s auction in New York a string of characters linked to a photographic collage of his earlier works for a stunning $69.3 million. Mocking them all, a Brooklyn film director received $85 for a string of characters attached to an audio file of him flatulating, hopefully in the face of this crypto folly.</p>
<p id="tec0000399">It could not have been otherwise. Betrayal of its early emancipatory promise was hard-wired into the nature of cryptocurrencies. Nakamoto’s ambition had been that Bitcoin should take off as a parallel currency. To succeed, people would need to want to use Bitcoin to buy train tickets, drinks and even houses. But to engineer the scarcity that he believed was necessary to give Bitcoin value, Nakamoto built into the Bitcoin code a fixed upper limit in the total number of Bitcoins – 21 million to be precise. Its limited supply meant that as soon as the demand for Bitcoin rose, so would its exchange rate with dollars. At some point, when the dollar value of Bitcoin rises above some threshold, it makes sense to keep your Bitcoin and use dollars to buy train tickets, drinks and houses, as well as more Bitcoin in the hope that its value will rise further. It was inevitable that the moment a cryptocurrency began to succeed as a currency it would stop working like a currency and would turn instead into a pyramid scheme, with its early adopters growing richer as more and more people bought into it.</p>
<p id="tec0000400">Besides this crypto aristocracy, the only true beneficiaries of crypto technologies have been the very institutions that crypto evangelists supposedly aimed to overthrow: Wall Street and the Big Tech conglomerates. For example, J.P. <span aria-label="190" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg190" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Morgan and Microsoft recently joined forces to run a ‘consortium blockchain’, based on Microsoft data centres, to improve their joint power to dominate financial services. Similar blockchain projects have been announced by Goldman Sachs and the Hong Kong central bank, by the World Bank, indeed by Mastercard and Visa themselves!<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_14" id="chapter007_en14" role="doc-noteref">14</a> Rather than inching towards Utopia, crypto has become another tool of cloud finance and engine for the accumulation of cloud capital.</p>
<p id="tec0000401">Blockchain is, no doubt, a fascinating tool. When I first encountered it, I wrote that it was a brilliant answer to a question we have not discovered yet. But if the question is how to fix capitalism or dethrone technofeudalism, this is not it. Both are encompassing and exploitative systems that by nature have the power to co-opt technical innovations to their own ends. Under capitalism, crypto serves financial capital. Under technofeudalism, it aids and abets the logic of cloud-capital accumulation. This does not mean that crypto tech will not, at some point, prove useful to progressives. If and when we manage to socialise cloud capital and democratise our economies, blockchain technologies will come in handy.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_15" id="chapter007_en15" role="doc-noteref">15</a> But before any of this becomes remotely possible, we need to answer the most pressing of questions: what is the alternative to technofeudalism? And if social democracy is impossible and crypto a false promise, how will we build it?</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000402"><em>Imagining Another Now</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000403">One reason that we, the left, are wallowing in perpetual defeat is our failure to answer the killer question once put to <span aria-label="191" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg191" role="doc-pagebreak"/>me in a pub by a self-described ‘cockney Tory’ who had heard that a socialist was in the house: ‘If you don’t like what we have, what would you replace it with? How would it work? I am all ears. Convince me!’ I didn’t even try. Not just because of the din in the crowded pub, which meant I could barely hear myself think, but primarily because I lacked a convincing answer.</p>
<p id="tec0000404">My consolation was that I was in excellent company. Karl Marx, not exactly a man lacking self-confidence or imagination, refused to go beyond vague references to the socialism or communism which he predicted and wanted to replace the Empire of Capital. Why? Marx’s own excuse for offering no socialist blueprint was smart: it is beyond the capacities of middle-class intellectuals working in the British Library reading room or chatting in their posh living rooms. Rather, it is the proletariat who, in pursuing their collective interests, should and will create socialism as they go along – or so Marx said. Today, we know from both the Soviet and the Western European experience with social democracy that this was wishful thinking: a bottom-up socialist blueprint has simply not transpired, anywhere. But what was my excuse? Trying to conjure up the blueprint for a realistic utopia is damned hard, not to mention risky. Nevertheless, without a convincing answer to that killer question, the prospect of recruiting people to the cause of reclaiming our minds, bodies and environment will remain hopeless.</p>
<p id="tec0000405">A few weeks after that pub encounter, I came across a review of a book I had written, the one addressed to your granddaughter, about how capitalism works.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_16" id="chapter007_en16" role="doc-noteref">16</a> It was by a political opponent, Ireland’s finance minister at the time. He surprised me with some kind words for the book but, predictably, was scathing towards my call for systemic change: <span aria-label="192" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg192" role="doc-pagebreak"/>‘An exhortation for the creation of an “authentic democracy” and the collective ownership of technology and the means of production,’ he wrote, ‘sits very poorly alongside his appreciation of entrepreneurship and individual initiative.’ Oops, I thought, the man is right. The time had come to stop hiding behind my little finger and to flesh out a blueprint for a convincing alternative system – one that combines collective ownership of the means of production, personal freedom, room for innovative thinking and technological progress and, yes, authentic democracy.</p>
<p id="tec0000406">The task was clear and daunting: I had to explain how production, distribution, innovation, land use, housing, money, prices and a host of other stuff would work in a society that has socialised land and capital, including its algorithmic, AI-powered, cloud-based variety. I would have to explain how international trade and money flows would work. What democracy would mean and how it would function. Between you and me, nothing short of panic describes my state of mind as I sat down to write a book that seemed like a duty bordering on purgatory.</p>
<p id="tec0000407">It took me a day or two to hit the wall. Every idea I had for how companies would be run, or how money would be issued, immediately crashed on the shoals of my own objections. Progress was impossible. Then, I had an epiphany. What does an author do if he disagrees with everything he writes? My answer was to write a novel populated with characters that each represented one of the various perspectives that were jostling for influence in my mind.</p>
<p id="tec0000408">Eventually, I managed to boil it down to three characters: Eva, a former Wall Street banker, would keep a check on my blueprint from a liberal, technocratic standpoint (one that the aforementioned Irish finance minister ought to <span aria-label="193" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg193" role="doc-pagebreak"/>appreciate). Iris, a retired anthropologist, would bring to the novel the Marxist-feminist perspective that you would love. And Costa, a brilliant technologist disillusioned by his experiences working within Big Tech, would shed light on the role of cloud capital. But one more issue still needed resolving.</p>
<p id="tec0000409">The guy at the pub wanted to know how his life would differ under my system in the here and now, with the technologies currently at hand, with our existing human stock, warts and all. I was not allowed, in other words, to project into a technologically more advanced future. Nor to populate my alternative system with people better, smarter or nicer than the ones we meet down the pub or in front of our bathroom mirror. In short, my blueprint had to be written as if it had been implemented already. However, since history matters, and everything we do is path-dependent, it would be daft to describe my system as if it existed in 2020 – the year the book would be published – without explaining how it had come about. In other words, I needed a believable alternative history of a political and social revolution that had occurred at some point in the past. To this end, I chose the year 2008 as the point when this alternative history diverged from our own. In my story, I imagined what might have happened if the protests and rebellions that had sprung up in the wake of the crash – gatherings like Occupy Wall Street, Spain’s <em>indignados</em>, and the protests in Athens at Syntagma Square – had actually succeeded.</p>
<p id="tec0000410">And yet it seemed important to me that my three characters somehow keep one foot in the reader’s side of history – our messed-up technofeudal reality – from which to assess and critique the alternative system I was conjuring up. How could this possibly work? Minds uninfected by science fiction might find this preposterous, but having misspent – as you <span aria-label="194" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg194" role="doc-pagebreak"/>well know – part of my youth immersed in science fiction, where parallel universes and wormholes are commonplace, the die was cast: I would imagine two parallel realities. One our own, in which the reader, myself, Eva, Iris and Costa live. And another in which alternative versions of ourselves inhabit a world where technofeudalism has been replaced by a technologically based socialism. (In the book, it is referred to as anarcho-syndicalism – but a simpler term would simply be technodemocracy.) The drama would be precipitated when an invention of Costa’s would open up a portal for written exchanges between the two, allowing the characters to offer one another descriptions of their alternative worlds.</p>
<p id="tec0000411">My answer to the guy in the pub, to the Irish finance minister, to anyone who wants to know what the alternative to technofeudalism is that I am proposing, can be found in the pages of the book that resulted: <em>Another Now: Dispatches from an alternative present</em>.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_17" id="chapter007_en17" role="doc-noteref">17</a> What follows is the gist of it, without the various perspectives, objections and debates of my three characters, but packaged simply in brief glimpses of my alternative to technofeudalism. Ready to imagine Another Now?</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000412"><em>Democratised companies</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000413">Imagine a corporation in which every employee has a single share that they receive when hired, the way a student collects a library card upon enrolling at university. This share, which cannot be sold or leased, grants each employee a single vote. All decisions – hiring, promotion, research, product development, pricing, strategy – are taken collectively, with each employee exercising their vote via the company’s intranet, <span aria-label="195" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg195" role="doc-pagebreak"/>which thus functions as a permanent shareholders’ assembly. Equal ownership does not, however, mean equal pay.</p>
<p id="tec0000414">Pay is determined by a democratic process that divides the company’s post-tax revenues into four slices: one to cover the firm’s fixed costs (such as equipment, licences, utility bills, rent and interest payments), another set aside for R&amp;D, a slice from which basic pay to staff is made and, lastly, a slice for bonuses. Again, the distribution between these four slices is decided collectively, on a one-person-one-vote basis.</p>
<p id="tec0000415">Any proposal to increase one slice must be accompanied by a proposal to reduce expenditure on one or more of the other slices. Competing proposals are put to a vote where employee-shareholders rank each proposal in order of preference via an electronic ballot form. If no plan wins an absolute majority of first preferences, a process of elimination takes place. The plan with the fewest first preferences is knocked out and its first-preference votes are reallocated to the voter’s second preference. This simple algorithmic process is repeated until one business plan has acquired more than half the votes cast.</p>
<p id="tec0000416">Having determined the amount of money the company will spend on the various slices, the basic pay slice is then divided equally among all staff – from persons recently employed as secretaries or cleaners to the firm’s star designers or engineers. Which leaves one important question unanswered: how do they decide the distribution of the bonus slice between staff? The answer is via a variant of the voting scheme made famous by the Eurovision Song Contest, in which each participating country is given a set number of points that it can allocate to the songs of every other country. In this spirit, once a year, employees are each given one hundred digital tokens to distribute among their <span aria-label="196" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg196" role="doc-pagebreak"/>colleagues. The idea is simple: you allot these tokens to those colleagues whom you believe to have contributed most during the previous year. Once the tokens have been distributed, the total bonus slice is allocated in proportion to the number of tokens each employee has received from their colleagues.</p>
<p id="tec0000417">The impact of legislating such a corporate governance system would be the equivalent of a large comet crashing into technofeudalism’s bedrock. On the most superficial level, it would liberate employees from the tyranny of self-serving managers, but on a structural level it would do so much more. First, it would eliminate the distinction between wages and profits; thus we have collective ownership and we have eliminated the fundamental class divide between those who own and collect profits or rents and those who lease their time for a wage. We have also abolished the market for shares – only an employee can own a share in a company, and only one share that can’t be sold or leased – thus cutting the umbilical cord that links finance and share market speculation. In a stroke, we have ended financialisation and destroyed private equity. We have also, most probably, done away with the need for regulators whose job is to break up large corporations before they establish monopolies. As collective decision-making becomes unwieldy in companies beyond a certain size – say, five hundred people – it seems wholly likely that the employee-shareholders would not form them and, in the case of already formed conglomerates, would vote to break them up in smaller companies.</p>
<p id="tec0000418">Most people I know, including generations of students I have taught, assume that capitalism equals markets. That socialism must mean the end of prices as signals to producers and consumers. Nothing could be further from the truth. Capitalist firms are market-free zones within which a <span aria-label="197" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg197" role="doc-pagebreak"/>non-market process extracts surplus value from employees which then takes the form of rent, profit and interest. The larger the firm, and the more cloud capital it employs, the greater the rents it extracts from a society whose markets malfunction as a result.</p>
<p id="tec0000419">In contrast, the democratised companies I propose here, and in <em>Another Now</em>, are more consistent with well-functioning, competitive markets in which prices – free from the scourge of rent and concentrated market power – are formed. Put differently, doing away with capitalist firms, through terminating labour and share markets, paves the ground for truly competitive product markets and a process of price formation that powers up the great engine of entrepreneurship and innovation which conventional thinking, wrongly, associates with capitalism.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_18" id="chapter007_en18" role="doc-noteref">18</a></p>
<p id="tec0000420">What would all this mean for the cloudalists? The various Bezoses, Zuckerbergs and Musks would wake up to find they owned a single share in ‘their’ company granting them a single vote. On every single item of the continuous-time agenda of the Amazon, Facebook, Twitter or Tesla decision-making process, they would have to sway a majority of their fellow, equally empowered, employee-shareholders. Control over the firm’s cloud capital, including the almighty algorithms at their centre, would be democratised, at least within the bounds of the company. Even so, cloud capital’s potency would be no less great – its nature as a produced means of behavioural modification would remain unchanged – and so the good society would need additional protections from it.</p>
<p id="tec0000421">One such protection would be a Social Accountability Act stipulating that every corporation be graded according to an index of social worthiness, to be compiled by panels of randomly selected citizens, the equivalent of juries, chosen from <span aria-label="198" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg198" role="doc-pagebreak"/>a diverse pool of stakeholders: the company’s customers, members of the communities it affects, and so on. If a company’s rating falls consistently below a certain threshold, a public inquiry may result in the company’s deregistration. A second, even more pertinent, social protection is afforded by the termination of ‘free’ services.</p>
<p id="tec0000422">We have learned the hard way what happens when services are funded by selling users’ attention to third parties. It turns the users into cloud serfs, whose labour enhances and reproduces cloud capital, further tightening its grip on our minds and behaviour. To replace the illusion of free services, our alternative reality features a micropayment platform, let’s call it ‘Penny For Your Thought’. This works a bit like Netflix’s subscription model but combined with the British National Health Service’s principle of universal provision. App developers needing our data have to pay to get it from consenting users, who are protected by a Bill of Digital Rights that guarantees us all the right to choose which of our data to sell and to whom. The combination of the micropayment platform and the Bill of Digital Rights terminates, in practice, the current attention-grabbing market model. At the same time, anyone using an app pays the developer for access to it. The sums involved are small for the individual but for an app with a large pool of users they add up. Would that not prevent some people from being able to afford digital services they need? No, because of the way money works in this alternative system.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000423"><em>Democratised money</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000424">Imagine that the central bank provided everyone with a free digital wallet, effectively a free bank account. To attract <span aria-label="199" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg199" role="doc-pagebreak"/>people to use it, a stipend (or basic dividend) is credited monthly to each account making universal basic income a reality. Taking one step further, the central bank pays interest to those who shift monies from their savings at commercial banks to their new digital wallet. In time, a mass if not total exodus would follow as people moved their savings from the private banks to this new public digital payments and savings system. Would this not require the central bank to mint vast amounts of money?</p>
<p id="tec0000425">Yes, the stipends will have to be minted anew, though not at a rate that exceeds the quantities central banks have been minting since 2008 to bolster permanently unstable private banks.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_19" id="chapter007_en19" role="doc-noteref">19</a> As for the rest of the money, it has already been minted by the private banks. All that happens here is that it migrates from the private banks’ unsafe ledger to the safe ledger of the central bank. As people and companies begin paying one another using this system, all money stays on the central bank ledger, moving from one part of it to another with every transaction, rather than being available to bankers and their shareholders to gamble with.</p>
<p id="tec0000426">This turns central banks from pliant servants of private bankers to something like a monetary commons. To oversee its operations, including the quantity of money in the system and the privacy of each person’s transactions, the central bank is answerable to, and monitored by, a Monetary Supervision Jury comprising randomly selected citizens and experts drawn from a wide range of professions.</p>
<p id="tec0000427">What about investment? In this system you can lend your savings to a start-up or to a mature firm but you can’t buy a chunk of any firm – since shares are distributed solely on the one-employee-one-share basis. Rather, you can lend your savings directly, either using your central bank digital wallet <span aria-label="200" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg200" role="doc-pagebreak"/>or via an intermediary – but with this crucial stipulation: that intermediary cannot create money out of thin air, as banks do today whenever they issue a loan, but must trade in already-existing funds from really-existing savers.</p>
<p id="tec0000428">What about taxation? Recall that there are three types of income. First, the basic dividends credited to citizens’ digital wallets by the central bank. Second, earnings from working in the democratised companies, comprising basic salary plus bonuses. Third, interest paid to savers by the central bank or by private intermediaries. None of these incomes are taxed. Nor are there any sales taxes, VAT or anything of that sort. So, who finances the state? Every company does via a fixed tax on all revenues, e.g. 5 per cent. Note that this is a fixed portion of total revenues, not profits, preventing the infinite scope for accounting tricks that dress up expenses as costs in order to shrink companies’ taxable income. The only other taxes fall on commercial land and buildings, discussed further below.</p>
<p id="tec0000429">When it comes to international trade and payments, a new international financial system guarantees continual wealth transfers to the Global South, while also restraining trade and financial imbalances of the type that inflate bubbles and cause financial crashes. The idea is that all trade and all money movements between different monetary jurisdictions – such as the UK, Germany, China and the United States – are denominated in a new digital international accounting unit, which I called the Kosmos. If the Kosmos value of a country’s imports exceed its exports, the country is charged an <em>imbalance levy</em>, in proportion to its trade deficit. Equally, if a country’s exports exceed its imports, it is also charged the same levy in proportion to its trade surplus. This terminates the mercantilist motive for one country persistently to extract <span aria-label="201" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg201" role="doc-pagebreak"/>value from another country by selling to it goods of greater value than those it imports from it, and, subsequently, lending them the money to continue buying from it – a form of vendor finance that places the weaker country in permanent debt bondage.</p>
<p id="tec0000430">Meanwhile, a second <em>surge levy</em> is charged to a country’s Kosmos account whenever too much money moves too quickly out of, or into, the country. For decades, developing countries were undermined whenever the ‘smart’ money, detecting future economic growth (e.g. South Korean, Thailand, some African countries), rushed in to buy land and companies before their price went up. As the money inflows surged, the prices of land and companies skyrocketed and false expectations regarding the level of growth set in, thus inflating bubbles. The moment the bubbles burst, as they inevitably do, the ‘smart’ money rushed out of the country faster than it had rushed in, leaving nothing but ruined lives and economies behind. The purpose, therefore, of the <em>surge levy</em> is to tax these speculative money movements to stop unnecessary damage to the weakest of countries.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_20" id="chapter007_en20" role="doc-noteref">20</a> Proceeds from these two levies are then used to fund direct green investments in the Global South.</p>
<p id="tec0000431">The one-employee-one-share-one-vote system has revolutionary effects: it brings to an end share and labour markets and the Empire of Capital, it democratises workplaces and it organically diminishes the size of conglomerates. The reconfiguration of the central bank’s ledger as a common payment and savings systems has similarly revolutionary effects: without actually banning private banks, it pulls the rug from under their feet by liberating us all from our dependence on them to make payments or to store our savings. Moreover, the basic dividend provision revolutionises our way of <span aria-label="202" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg202" role="doc-pagebreak"/>thinking about work, time and value, liberating us from the oppressive moral equation of paid drudgery and virtue. Finally, the Kosmos system balances the international ebb and flow of goods and money, preventing the exploitation of weaker economies by the more powerful ones while funding green investments in the parts of the world they are most needed.</p>
<p id="tec0000432">These are the fundamental building blocks of an economy liberated from the tyranny of capital and, thus, denying technofeudalism the foothold it needs to take us over. The question now arises: how exactly do we free our societies from the tyranny of rent – the ancient ground-rent variety, which survived capitalism’s defeat of feudalism, and the cloud rents on which technofeudalism relies?</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000433"><em>The cloud and the land as a commons</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000434">The coffee is almost ready. Your laptop is booting up. Before long, coffee mug in hand, you are perusing the morning’s newsfeed from a media site run from your neighbourhood library. The first item on the news concerns an upcoming local referendum, the second is beamed in from Brazil on the struggle to compensate its indigenous peoples for decades of illegal logging, the third relates a debate within the current membership of the Monetary Supervision Jury on whether the central bank should lower the interest rate savers receive or, alternatively, increase everyone’s basic dividend. It is a little dry for your taste so, careful to avoid the sports pages, you click on your favourite section devoted to archaeology, which is constantly updated by researchers from all over the world. Ah yes, now this gets your pulse racing!</p>
<p id="tec0000435"><span aria-label="203" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg203" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Your newsfeed and its accompanying sections are compiled by an algorithm calibrated and maintained by the local public media centre which is, in turn, owned by your municipality but controlled by local people selected through a combination of lotteries and elections. Sometimes you get bored with their newsfeed and turn to a digital world map full of dots, each one representing other local public media centres whose newsfeeds you can access at a click.</p>
<p id="tec0000436">Every time you visit a media centre outside your area, a tiny payment leaves your central bank account and helps fund the good people who offer you a window to their world. No ads, no behavioural modification algorithms. As for these tiny payments, they are insignificant in comparison to the basic dividend paid to you by the central bank monthly. Besides, paying them makes you feel good. They buy you – and everyone else – civilisation. They offer you a bay window onto the world, to cooperative media centres strewn all over the planet trying their hardest to provide ‘good, diverse, exciting information, knowledge and a touch of wisdom’ – as your local media outlet advertises its wares.</p>
<p id="tec0000437">Your coffee mug empty, it is time to go to work. You tap on your phone’s travel app, also provided by your municipality, and then tap again on ‘work’. A list appears of fares offered by various driver cooperatives, alongside information on where and when you can catch the nearest bus or train. You recall with a brief shudder the days of Uber and Lyft, those cloud fiefs that exploited drivers’ labour, turning them into cloud proles, and passengers’ data, turning you into a cloud serf. The bad memory dissipates when you remind yourself that, these days, the driver-owners and the public transport staff control the algorithms – not the other way round. And you set off with a spring in your step now <span aria-label="204" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg204" role="doc-pagebreak"/>that you are no longer employed by a capitalist firm, owned by opaque shell companies, that treated you like a cross between a robot and human fodder. Life is still a minefield of worries, especially as we may have wrecked the climate irreparably, but at least work is not systematically soul-destroying.</p>
<p id="tec0000438">At work, you have an app on your phone that gives you access to all sorts of shareholder-employee ballots, some of which you vote in and some of which you choose to skip. If you have an idea for a new way of doing things or a new product, you post it on the company’s Ideas Board and wait to see who, among your colleagues, wants to work with you to develop it. If no one does, you can still go ahead and re-post the idea once it is better developed. Things are not perfect. Human nature always finds ways of messing up even the best of systems. Your colleagues, if they summon a majority, can vote to have you fired. But the atmosphere at work is now one of shared responsibility which reduces stress and creates an environment in which mutual respect has a better chance to flourish.</p>
<p id="tec0000439">On your way home, as your cab exits the commercial zone, you cast your mind back to the <em>sad ages</em> when, to have somewhere to live, people had to choose between mortgage debt bondage and renting; between life in thrall to either the banker or the landlord; between predatory mortgage rates and rapacious rents. Now, every region is run by a County Association that oversees the division of land between commercial and social zones, so that rents collected from the former fund the provision of social housing in the latter. As is the norm, the people who officiate at the County Association are selected randomly – with the help of an algorithm <span aria-label="205" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg205" role="doc-pagebreak"/>that guarantees fair representation of the various groups and communities within the county. Home is no longer a constant source of anxiety but somewhere you feel able to put down roots for the long term.</p>
<p id="tec0000440">I’ll leave you to imagine the rest of your life in this alternative present, while I explain a bit more about this most crucial aspect of it: the ownership of land and property, that oldest of foundations of both the feudal and capitalist systems, and the sharing of power.</p>
<p id="tec0000441">The key to the rent charging system in the commercial zone is a Permanent Auction Subletting Scheme (PASS), a mechanism designed to ensure that communities can extract maximum rents from their commercial zones with which to invest in their social zones. PASS works a little like the famous trick for fairly distributing a cake between two people: one person cuts, the other chooses. In the same spirit, PASS creates a permanent auction that pits current occupiers of a commercial space against prospective occupiers.</p>
<p id="tec0000442">Once a year, as a current occupier in the commercial zone, you must visit PASS and submit your valuation of your property based on two rules. First, PASS will compute your monthly rent as a fixed portion of your self-declared market value – with no audits, no red tape, no haggling, no estate agents. Great, right? But here comes the second rule: anyone can, at any point in the future, visit PASS and offer a higher valuation, in which case you are out and they are in within six months. This second rule guarantees that you have an incentive to declare your valuation as truthfully and accurately as you can. If you overstate your true valuation, you will end up paying a rent higher than it’s worth. And if you understate it, you increase the chances of regretting your valuation – the <span aria-label="206" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg206" role="doc-pagebreak"/>moment someone offers a higher value, one closer to its true valuation, and in so doing boots you out.</p>
<p id="tec0000443">The beauty of PASS is that the County Association does not have to set rents in the commercial zone. In the first instance, their job is simply to decide which land and buildings to assign to the commercial zones and which to the social zones. If they set aside too much land for social zones, they will have less money to invest in them. Conversely, expanding the commercial zones leaves less room for social housing and social enterprises. Once the County Association has decided how to resolve the trade-off, their second, harder task awaits: defining the criteria according to which social housing – especially the more desirable homes – are distributed. This is the toughest nut to crack. So who sits on the County Association is crucial.</p>
<p id="tec0000444">An elected County Association would replace the tyranny of land ownership with the tyranny of electoral systems, which have an inherent propensity to beget powerful hierarchies. Knowing this, ancient Athenian democrats opposed elections and replaced them with lotteries – the idea in which the Western jury system has its roots. If anything can recreate a land commons in a technologically advanced society, your County Association, comprised of randomly selected locals, is surely it.</p>
<p id="tec0000445">The same principle extends beyond the regions and the counties to the governance of your nation as a whole, which takes place with the help of a nationwide Citizens’ Assembly. Comprising randomly selected citizens from all over the land, this functions as a test bed of ideas, policies and legislation. Deliberation by its juror members helps shape the bills that Parliament later debates and passes.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_21" id="chapter007_en21" role="doc-noteref">21</a> The demos, at long last, has been put back into democracy.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000446"><em><span aria-label="207" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg207" role="doc-pagebreak"/>A cloud rebellion to overthrow technofeudalism</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000447">Over the course of this book, I have outlined the system that I have come to believe is replacing, and in many contexts has already replaced, capitalism: the system I call technofeudalism. Whenever I have presented this argument in the past, it has invariably been met with consternation and even anger among those on the left. Understandably so: anyone who finds solace, as you did, Dad, in the faith that capitalism is bound to be replaced by socialism, as Marx predicted it would be, is bound to feel disheartened and dismayed that post-capitalism has arrived but socialism has not – indeed, that the system that has replaced it is even worse. But there is another, more troubling reason for their reaction.</p>
<p id="tec0000448">A Marxist activist once put it to me splendidly: ‘Yanis, if you are right that exploitation takes place beyond the confines of the capitalist firm,’ he said with disarming honesty, ‘then organising the proletariat is never going to be enough!’ This is precisely my point. I am not suggesting that organising factory workers, train drivers, teachers and nurses is no longer necessary. What I am saying is that it is far from sufficient. In a world increasingly dominated by cloud capital, which is produced largely by the free labour of unwaged cloud serfs, organising the proletariat – and indeed the precariat – is not going to cut it. To stand any chance of overthrowing technofeudalism and putting the demos back into democracy, we need to gather together not just the traditional proletariat and the cloud proles but also the cloud serfs and, indeed, at least some of the vassal capitalists. Nothing less than such a grand coalition that includes them all can undermine technofeudalism sufficiently.</p>
<p id="tec0000449"><span aria-label="208" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg208" role="doc-pagebreak"/>It may sound like a tall order – and it is. But resistance to capital’s exorbitant power was always a tall order. When I think of what it took to organise a trade union in the nineteenth century, I shudder. Workers, miners, dockers, shearers, seamstresses faced beatings by mounted police and violence from thugs in the capitalists’ employ. Above all, they faced losing their jobs at a time when forgoing a day’s wages meant hunger for their families. Even when they managed to stage a successful strike, whatever wage rise they secured was shared by the non-strikers, adding to a calculus that already weighed heavily against mobilisation. And yet they mobilised. They did so against the odds, expecting certain massive personal losses in exchange for small and uncertain shared benefits.</p>
<p id="tec0000450">Technofeudalism erects a great new barrier to mobilisation against it. But it also bestows a great new power upon those who dare dream of a coalition to topple it. The great new barrier is the physical isolation of cloud serfs and cloud proles from one another. We interact with and are subject to cloud capital via our individual screens, via our personal mobile phones, via the digital devices that monitor and manage Amazon warehouse workers. Collective action is made harder when people have fewer opportunities to come together. But herein lies the great power that cloud capital presents to its potential rebels: a capacity to build coalitions, organise and take action via the cloud.</p>
<p id="tec0000451">In its early days, this was one of the promises of Twitter, of course: that it could enable the mobilisation of the masses. From the Arab Spring to Black Lives Matter, we have seen how far that promise has been realised and how far it has not. But I am talking not just about a mobilisation <em>via</em> the cloud but about actions that could actually take place using <span aria-label="209" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg209" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the systems and technologies <em>of</em> the cloud. In <em>Another Now</em> I imagined global action targeting one cloudalist company at a time – starting with Amazon. Imagine an international coalition of trades unions calling upon Amazon warehouse workers worldwide to stay away for one day.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_22" id="chapter007_en22" role="doc-noteref">22</a> On its own, such action is feeble. But not so if a broader campaign persuaded enough of its users and customers globally not to visit the Amazon website just for that one day, to resist their status as serfs or vassals for that brief window. The personal inconvenience involved would be trivial but its cumulative effect remarkable. Even if it were only mildly successful, causing say a 10 per cent drop in Amazon’s usual revenues, while Amazon’s warehouse strike disrupted deliveries for twenty-four hours, such action might prove enough to push Amazon’s share price down in ways that no traditional labour action could achieve. This is how cloud proles and cloud serfs can unite effectively. It’s what I call <em>cloud mobilisation</em>.</p>
<p id="tec0000452">The beauty of cloud mobilisation is that it stands on its head the conventional calculus of collective action. Instead of maximal personal sacrifice for minimal collective gain, we now have the opposite: minimal personal sacrifice delivering large collective and personal gains.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter007_en_23" id="chapter007_en23" role="doc-noteref">23</a> This reversal has the potential to pave the way towards a coalition of cloud serfs and cloud proles that is large enough to disrupt cloudalists’ control over billions of people.</p>
<p id="tec0000453">Naturally, actions of this sort against one or even several major cloudalist enterprises won’t be enough. The cloud rebellion I envision will need to recruit to its cause many diverse constituencies – including, for example, anyone who loses sleep when their water and energy bills arrive. Smartly calculated, targeted payment strikes could be used to cause an equivalent drop in the private utility companies’ share and <span aria-label="210" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg210" role="doc-pagebreak"/>derivatives prices. Timed well, these peaceful guerrilla strikes could do a lot of damage to the political and economic clout of conglomerates whose fates are increasingly fused with that of cloud finance. The rebellion could gather international support as well if it used, say, a consumer boycott in the Unites States specifically to target a company for its squeezing of workers in Nigeria or the destruction of natural reserves in the Congo.</p>
<p id="tec0000454">Another campaign could involve inviting nominations from all over the world for companies with the worst record of zero-hours contracts or low pay, big carbon footprints or poor working conditions, or those that are in the habit of ‘downsizing’ to boost share prices – and then organising a mass withholding of pension contributions to the pension funds that own shares in those companies. Merely announcing the targeting of a pension fund would be enough to send its shares crashing and to cause an exodus of worried investors from equity funds related to it.</p>
<p id="tec0000455">Inspired by Wikileaks, I imagined in <em>Another Now</em> a group of rebels writing and uploading digital viruses whose purpose would simply be transparency: to trace and reveal to the world the hidden digital connections between cloudalists, government agencies and bad actors like fossil fuel companies. How and whether this is possible, I do not know, but I am convinced that if by whatever means these institutions knew that they had billions of eyes trained on their actions, they would be paralysed – and as the scales fell from those billions of eyes, the coalition would summon further allies and support.</p>
<p id="tec0000456">None of this is either easy or inevitable. But is it harder or less likely than what the miners, the seamstresses and the dockworkers envisioned and sacrificed their very lives to <span aria-label="211" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg211" role="doc-pagebreak"/>achieve in the nineteenth century? The cloud takes – but the cloud also gives to those who want to reclaim freedom and democracy. It is up to them, to us, to decide, and to prove, which is greater.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000457"><em>Back to your question, one last time</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000458">Your younger self was on to something. Private capital, you surmised back in the 1940s, can only be owned by the very few. As long as it is privately owned, it’s in its nature to concentrate. But concentrated capital means concentrated power. Which means that, unless society takes capital over, it’s all futile: freedom, autonomy, social democracy, liberal democracy – every single one an empty word in the business of embellishing and prettifying an inevitable Tyranny of Capital.</p>
<p id="tec0000459">When in 1981 the socialists won the Greek general election by a landslide, you were glad we no longer had to fear the secret police. Nevertheless, as everyone around you was getting drunk on the spirit of the moment, you remained defiantly pessimistic. Without democratising work, you insisted, social democracy is impossible no matter how well meaning or smart the social democrats in government. History came down on your side, but not in a way that pleased you.</p>
<p id="tec0000460">Our greatest defeat was, of course, not the failure of social democracy in Greece or anywhere else. It was the failure of the Soviet experiment, the only large-scale attempt to take capital under society’s control. It produced significant innovations, in both science and technology. But the Soviet central planning system failed to press these into society’s <span aria-label="212" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg212" role="doc-pagebreak"/>service. Soviet scientists invented cybernetics with the potential, decades before Google or Amazon, to coordinate people’s preferences and efforts automatically. Except that the Soviet top-down system could not exploit these for the benefit of the society it was meant to serve. And so appalling authoritarianism and daily drudgery led to total defeat in 1991.</p>
<p id="tec0000461">Subsequently, private capital was free to go on a global rampage that culminated in the crash of 2008 and the rise of its most formidable mutation – a cloud-based capital with a monstrous power to usurp minds and markets. Thanks to the endless funds of central banks with which the cloudalists have built their empires, we are all now, like Stelarc’s Movatar, wired into the circuits of technofeudalism.</p>
<p id="tec0000462">So, there you have it, Dad, the answer to your question is in. It bears good and bad news. The bad news is that the internet bred a form of capital which killed capitalism but replaced it with something far worse. The good news is that we now have at our disposal tools that neither the Soviets nor the reforming social democrats ever had and with which we might re-establish a new commons. In short, we live under a new form of serfdom but we hold in our hands a hitherto non-existent golden opportunity to realise your dream of a leisured, freedom-maximising, bottom-up communism.</p>
<p id="tec0000463">How likely is it that we take advantage of it? I am damned if I know. But, then again, could people like us in, say, 1776 realistically have imagined universal suffrage or the abolition of slavery? What I do know is that which you and Hesiod taught me: our remarkable knack for technological revolutions does not let us stay put. It pushes us violently into contradictions – and the choices that go with them. We are fast approaching a fork in the road where our path will lead <span aria-label="213" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg213" role="doc-pagebreak"/>either to a world resembling <em>Star Trek</em>, where machines help us improve ourselves, or to a dystopia like <em>The Matrix</em>, in which humans are merely the fuel that powers an empire of machines.</p>
<p id="tec0000464">To most people, I am sure, barbarism, climate Armageddon, <em>The Matrix</em> seem much more likely than any good outcome. Then again, whenever people thought good outcomes were guaranteed – I am thinking of your comrades in the prison camp who believed that a redemptive communism was just around the corner – the result was either a new type of tyranny or defeat. You, on the other hand, bore the hardships of that prison camp despite harbouring deep doubts in place of your comrades’ certainties. Today, we must do the same. As long as there is even the remotest chance of a successful cloud rebellion, then our only chance of achieving a good life – of the <em>eudaimonia</em>, or flourishing, which Aristotle believed to be our ultimate aim – is to hope and to act without the slightest of guarantees. At the very least, we do not have fewer reasons to persevere than you did in that prison-camp hellhole.</p>
<p id="tec0000465">Marx famously described our condition under capitalism as one of ‘alienation’, owing to our having no ownership of the products of our labour, to our having no say in how things get done. Under technofeudalism, we no longer own our minds. Every proletarian is turning into a cloud prole during working hours and into a cloud serf the rest of the time. Every self-employed striver mutates into a cloud vassal, while every self-employed struggler becomes a cloud serf. While privatisation and private equity asset-strip all physical wealth around us, cloud capital goes about the business of asset-stripping our brains. To own our minds individually, we must own cloud capital collectively. It’s the only way we can <span aria-label="214" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg214" role="doc-pagebreak"/>turn our cloud-based artefacts from a produced means of behaviour modification to a produced means of human collaboration and emancipation.</p>
<p id="tec0000466">Cloud serfs, cloud proles and cloud vassals of the world, unite! We have nothing to lose but our mind-chains!</p>
