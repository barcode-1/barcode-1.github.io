<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000122">The last time you left the family home in Paleo Phaliro was in the summer of 2020 when you came to visit us on the island of Aegina, as you liked to do every summer. That journey to Aegina was a joyous break from the suffocating lockdown of the pandemic’s first phase. But it must have taken its toll because the following morning you didn’t emerge from your room until well after eleven. You found me on the veranda, peering into news sites on my laptop. I was beside myself. As you sat down next to me, I exclaimed: ‘The Age of Cloud Capital has just begun. In London!’</p>
<p id="tec0000123">Half an hour or so earlier, the people of Britain had woken up to the news that the pandemic had caused the worst recession in history. Apparently, the UK’s national income had fallen by a whopping 20.4 per cent, far worse than any comparable figures in America or continental Europe.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter004_en_1" id="chapter004_en1" role="doc-noteref">1</a> Wretched news it certainly was, though not of the sort that undermines one’s world view. It was what followed fifteen minutes later, just before you woke up, that changed the way I saw the world. Instead of plummeting in response to the data, the London Stock Exchange jumped up by 2.3 per cent!<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter004_en_2" id="chapter004_en2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></p>
<p id="tec0000124">‘We are witnessing something utterly at odds with any variety of capitalism,’ I remember telling you with as much authority as I could muster.</p>
<p id="tec0000125">‘Nah, capitalism is full of paradoxes,’ you replied.</p>
<p id="tec0000126">‘But, Dad, this is not one of capitalism’s many paradoxes – it <span aria-label="93" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg93" role="doc-pagebreak"/>is unequivocal proof that the world of money has, finally, decoupled from the capitalist world.’</p>
<p id="tec0000127">Unimpressed, you chose to stare out over the Saronic Sea towards the mountains of the Peloponnese, leaving me to reckon with what had truly gone down in London on that Wednesday morning in August 2020.</p>
<p id="tec0000128">Share markets do rise in response to bad news, but only when the news, however awful, turns out at least somewhat better than anticipated. Had stockbrokers predicted, say, a 22 per cent fall in the UK’s national income, markets would have had good cause to rise if the actual fall on the day was ‘only’ 20.4 per cent. Except that, on that Wednesday, the markets were expecting a drop of no more than 15 per cent. That’s what made 12 August 2020 so bizarre: news far worse than anticipated had caused the share market to rise. Nothing like it had happened before.</p>
<p id="tec0000129">So, what <em>had</em> happened? The news, it turns out, was so bad that traders in the City of London had the following realisation: ‘When things are <em>this</em> dismal, the Bank of England panics. And what have panicky central banks been doing since the crash of 2008? They print money and give it to us. And what do we do with all the freshly minted dough from the central bank? We buy shares, sending their price up. And if prices are destined to go up, only a fool would miss out on the action. A wall of printed money is surely on its way to us. Time to buy!’ And buy they did, causing the City of London to defy the gravitational laws of capitalism.</p>
<p id="tec0000130">The trend was not confined to London. As the pandemic began to rip through our communities, authorities on both sides of the Atlantic, in Japan and elsewhere, responded by doing a lot more of what they had been doing since the American Minotaur’s death in 2008: printing money to give <span aria-label="94" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg94" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to the financiers in the hope that it would buttress investment in business, thus generating stable jobs and preventing the economy from collapsing. It didn’t. Fearing that run-of-the-mill businesses would not be able to repay them, the financiers lent the central bank money only to Big Business. And Big Business either refused to invest or invested solely in cloud capital.</p>
<p id="tec0000131">Conglomerates founded on traditional terrestrial capital, like General Electric and Volkswagen, refused to invest the interest-free central bank money because, when they surveyed the ongoing carnage of the pandemic, they saw the same thing their bankers had seen: masses of little people condemned to low wages, bullshit jobs and diminished prospects – a sea of people unable to afford new, high-value products. So why invest in such stuff? Instead, they would do something riskless, profitable and stress-free: they used it to buy back their own company’s shares – boosting their company’s share price and, along with it, their own bonuses.</p>
<p id="tec0000132">Meanwhile, Big Tech was having an even more fabulous pandemic. While the US economy shed 30 million jobs in a single month, Amazon bucked the trend, appearing to a swathe of Americans as a hybrid of the Red Cross, delivering essential parcels to confined citizens, and Roosevelt’s New Deal, hiring 100,000 extra staff and paying them a couple of extra dollars an hour to boot. True, Big Tech did invest the central bank cash, and it did create new jobs – but the jobs it created were those of cloud proles and the investment was in building up its cloud capital. Even cloudalist companies that had a bad pandemic, like Uber and Airbnb whose customers were unable to use their services, took the central bank money and invested in more cloud capital as if there were no pandemic.</p>
<p id="tec0000133"><span aria-label="95" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg95" role="doc-pagebreak"/>It was the pandemic, with the flood of state money it unleashed, that ushered in the Age of Cloud Capital. And if we want a milestone with which to mark its formal arrival, that summer’s morning will do nicely. But as I have hinted already, the story of the rise of cloud capital on the back of state money actually begins earlier than this, for it was in the wake of the crash of 2008 that state money began to be printed en masse by the world’s central banks and started to have its strange and counter-intuitive effect on profit.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000134"><em>The secret of the new ruling class</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000135">Your fireside stories of metalworkers, and ironsmiths in particular, accelerating history fascinated me no end, as you know. In the decades since, however, I have become more sceptical of narratives that place too much emphasis on technology and not enough on how powerful groups seize and manipulate it to achieve and maintain dominion over others. The steam engine would have been a historical footnote were it not for the capitalists who weaponised it so as to depose the then ruling class, the feudalists.</p>
<p id="tec0000136">However, it is not a given that every magnificent new technological breakthrough will spawn a distinctly new form of capital to be seized upon by some new revolutionary class. The technological breakthroughs of the Second Industrial Revolution – the electricity grids, the telegraph, later the telephone, highways packed with automobiles, television networks – these expansive networks of phenomenal machinery may have spawned Big Business, Big Finance, the Great Depression, the War Economy, Bretton Woods, the post-war technostructure, the European Union and built the modern <span aria-label="96" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg96" role="doc-pagebreak"/>world that your generation and mine took for granted, but they gave rise to neither a new type of capital nor a new class who could challenge the capitalists for dominance.</p>
<p id="tec0000137">But the technologies that spawned cloud capital have proved more revolutionary than any of their predecessors. Through them, cloud capital has developed capacities that previous types of capital goods never had. It has become at once an attention-holder, a desire-manufacturer, a driver of proletarian labour (of cloud proles), an elicitor of massive free labour (from cloud serfs) and, to boot, the creator of totally privatised digital transaction spaces (cloud fiefs like amazon.com) in which neither buyers nor sellers enjoy any of the options they would in normal markets.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter004_en_3" id="chapter004_en3" role="doc-noteref">3</a> As a result, its owners – the cloudalists – have acquired the ability to do that which the Edisons, the Westinghouses and the Fords never could: to turn themselves into a revolutionary class actively displacing the capitalists from the top of society’s pecking order.</p>
<p id="tec0000138">In the process, the cloudalists – some consciously, others unthinkingly – have changed everything that previous varieties of capitalism had taught us to take for granted: the idea of what constitutes a commodity, the ideal of the autonomous individual, the ownership of identity, the propagation of culture, the context of politics, the nature of the state, the texture of geopolitics. The pressing question is: how did the cloudalists finance all this?</p>
<p id="tec0000139">The early industrialists funded their factories, steamships and canals with the blood and sweat of African slave labour and loot from American and South Asian lands and peoples. Later, the Edisons, the Westinghouses and the Fords used monies conjured from thin air by private bankers who morphed into Big Finance in the process. The cloudalists did <span aria-label="97" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg97" role="doc-pagebreak"/>something subtler and more impressive: they helped themselves to the rivers of cash that were being printed by the central banks of developed capitalist states.</p>
<p id="tec0000140">It was nothing short of a coup. Imagine getting the world’s richest capitalist states to print the money that allows you to build a new type of capital stock. Imagine that this new type of capital stock comes with the inbuilt superpower to get billions of people to reproduce it on your behalf for free. Imagine further that this type of capital, funded by state monies and reproduced by citizens’ free labour, intensifies your power to extract surplus value from proletarians who are working for shrinking wages under worsening conditions – but also from capitalists forced to remove their wares from traditional markets and to sell them via your cloud capital. You wouldn’t even need to laugh all the way to the bank since you would be much wiser to keep your stupendous gains stowed in some digital wallet within your cloud capital empire rather than in an account with some pathetic banker.</p>
<p id="tec0000141">It sounds implausible. How on earth did the cloudalists convince major central banks to fund them in this way? The answer is: they didn’t have to.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000142"><em>2008’s unintended consequences</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000143">In the fifteen years since capitalism’s near-death experience, central bankers have been printing monies and channelling them to the financiers, entirely of their own accord. In their minds, they have been saving capitalism. In reality, they have been upending it by helping to finance the emergence of cloud capital. But that’s how history arrives: on the coat-tails of unintended consequences.</p>
<p id="tec0000144"><span aria-label="98" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg98" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The central bank money-printing bonanza began in 2008, shortly after the comprehensive implosion of the West’s banking sector. Politicians and central bankers then feared that if they let the banks fail and people’s savings disappear, as Herbert Hoover’s administration had done in 1929, they would precipitate a second Great Depression. So at their London summit in April 2009, the G7’s central bankers – along with their presidents and prime ministers – agreed to do whatever it took to refloat the banks. That was sensible.</p>
<p id="tec0000145">What was preposterous was that, in addition to saving the failed banks, they bailed out the quasi-criminal bankers responsible for their failure, along with their lethal practices. And far worse, in addition to practising socialism for the bankers, they subjected workers and the middle class to vicious austerity.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter004_en_4" id="chapter004_en4" role="doc-noteref">4</a> Cutting public expenditure in the midst of a Great Recession is always a terrible idea. Doing so while also printing mountains of money for the financiers wins the prize for conspicuous stupidity. Not only was it a brazen double standard that did untold damage to a generation’s faith in the political class, it did something lethal to the economy.</p>
<p id="tec0000146">Austerity is not just bad for workers and people in need of state support during tough times, it also murders investment. In any economy, what we spend collectively translates automatically into what we earn collectively. The definition of a recession is when private expenditure is falling. By reducing public expenditure at precisely the same moment, the state accelerates the decline of economy-wide expenditure and thus hastens the rate at which a society’s total income is falling. And if society’s total income is falling, businesses are hardly going to spend money building up capacity when consumers don’t have the money to buy. That’s how austerity slays investment.</p>
<p id="tec0000147"><span aria-label="99" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg99" role="doc-pagebreak"/>With investment first knocked out by the crash of 2008 and finished off soon after by austerity, throwing new money at the financiers was never going to resurrect it. Put yourself in the position of a capitalist at a time when austerity is eliminating your customers’ income. Suppose I give you a billion dollars to play with for free, i.e. at a zero interest rate. Naturally you will take the free billion but as we’ve established you would be mad to invest it in new production lines. So what are you going to do with the free cash? You could buy real estate or art or, better still, shares in your own company. That way, the shares in your company appreciate in value and, if you are the CEO running it, your stature and share-linked bonuses rise too. No new investment, in other words, but a lot more power in the hands of the powerful.</p>
<p id="tec0000148">This is exactly what happened. Seeing that the vast majority were likely to be stuck in poverty and precarity for the foreseeable future, Big Business went on history’s deepest and longest investment strike, while spending large sums on things like real estate deals that gentrified neighbourhoods and deepened divides. Every Gilded Age has seen inequality rise, with the rich profiting faster than the poor. The post-2008 era was different. Inequality rose not because the poor saw their incomes rise more slowly than the rich – no, their incomes actually fell, just as the financiers and Big Business raked it in.</p>
<p id="tec0000149">When an activist state makes fabulously wealthier the same bankers whose quasi-criminal activities brought misery to the majority, while they are punished with self-defeating austerity, two new calamities beckon: poisoned politics and permanent stagnation. The poisoned politics we need not elaborate on – from Greece’s neo-Nazis to America’s Donald Trump we have all lived through the nightmare. But <span aria-label="100" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg100" role="doc-pagebreak"/>permanent stagnation? Why would more wealth for the ultra-rich stagnate capitalism? And how did it lead to the funding of cloud capital?</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000150"><em>Poisoned money, gilded stagnation</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000151">The term ‘inflation’ refers to an increase across the board in the price of most things. Sometimes, when the price of bread rises it’s simply because flour has suddenly become scarcer or bread more fashionable. But in the case of inflation, the price of one thing rises because the price of <em>everything</em> is going up, so <em>everyone</em> needs more dollars, yen or euros in order to buy their loaf of bread or cup of coffee or smartphone, not just the baker. That’s how inflation <em>depletes money’s exchange value</em>.</p>
<p id="tec0000152">Capitalism famously drove a wedge between the value and the price of things. Money was no exception. Money’s exchange value reflects people’s readiness to hand over valuable things for given sums of cash – a value that inflation diminishes, as we have just seen. But under capitalism, money also acquired a distinct market price: the rate of interest you must pay in order to lease a pile of cash for a given period. The price of potatoes drops when there are stockpiled potatoes that no one wants to buy. In just the same way, when the demand for money (for loans, that is) lingers below the quantity of money available to be lent, its price – the interest rate – declines. Under capitalism, Big Business has the capacity to borrow most of the money that lenders, mostly rich people with large savings, are willing to lend (which is what they are doing when they invest in a bond). So it is Big Business, with its appetite for borrowing, <span aria-label="101" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg101" role="doc-pagebreak"/>that determines the overall demand for money. In theory, central banks are able to influence interest rates by adjusting the rate at which they lend money to other banks, allowing them to pass on the lower rate, and thereby to stimulate or discourage investment. But overall interest rates are determined, as with any market, by the overall supply of and demand for money.</p>
<p id="tec0000153">After 2008, and especially during the pandemic, a strange thing happened. Money held its exchange value – that whole period, from late 2008 to early 2022, was one of very low (sometimes negative) inflation – but at the same time its price (i.e. the interest rate) tanked, even turning <em>negative</em> on many occasions.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter004_en_5" id="chapter004_en5" role="doc-noteref">5</a> This was a reflection of the fact that austerity was nullifying business investment and so business people’s demand for money was pitiful. But surely, if the central banks keep reducing interest rates, there would eventually come a point where money was sufficiently cheap that borrowing and investment would pick up again? Not so.</p>
<p id="tec0000154">In the case of potatoes, microchips or cars, falling prices generally cure an oversupply problem (i.e. where supply outweighs demand) in exactly this way: bargain-hunters swoop in while producers cut output, and thus the price ‘correction’ eliminates the excess supply. But when it comes to money, something different happens. When its price – the interest rate – drops fast, capitalists panic. Instead of rejoicing that they can now borrow more cheaply, they think: ‘Sure, it is a good thing that I can borrow for next to nothing. But for the central bank to allow interest rates to drop so much, things must be looking grim! I won’t invest even if they hand me the money.’ That’s the reason investment refused to recover, even after central bankers cut money’s official price to almost zero. And that was only half of their post-2008 nightmare.</p>
<p id="tec0000155"><span aria-label="102" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg102" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The other half was the failed bankers’ stranglehold over everyone, including central banks and governments – a legacy of three decades of the American Minotaur’s rule over global capitalism. Their stranglehold came in handy once their banks began sequentially to topple between 2007 and 2011. One panicky phone call was usually all it took for a banker to get the state to bail him out and give him an open-ended overdraft facility.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter004_en_6" id="chapter004_en6" role="doc-noteref">6</a> From late 2008 to early 2022, Europe’s, America’s and Japan’s central banks pushed walls of freshly minted cash into the accounts of the financiers,<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter004_en_7" id="chapter004_en7" role="doc-noteref">7</a> making the interest rate conundrum far worse than it already was. By boosting magnificently the supply of monies that Big Business refused to invest,<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter004_en_8" id="chapter004_en8" role="doc-noteref">8</a> socialism for financiers pushed the interest rate deeper and deeper towards negative territory.</p>
<p id="tec0000156">It was a strange new world. Negative prices make sense in the case of bads, the opposite of goods. When a factory wants to get rid of toxic waste, it charges a negative price for it: its managers pay someone to get rid of it, a costly process especially if it is done in an ecologically considerate manner.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter004_en_9" id="chapter004_en9" role="doc-noteref">9</a> But how could money become a bad to be offloaded? When central banks began to treat money like a car manufacturer treats spent sulphuric acid, or a nuclear power station its radioactive wastewater, that’s when we knew there was something rotten in the kingdom of financialised capitalism.</p>
<p id="tec0000157">How can money acquire a <em>negative</em> price? It was you, Dad, who helped me come to grips with the paradox of negative interest rates. By introducing me to Einstein’s theory that light has two natures, you opened my mind to the twin nature of labour, capital and, yes, money. Money’s first nature is that of a commodity that we trade like any other for other commodities. But money, like language, is also a reflection of our <span aria-label="103" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg103" role="doc-pagebreak"/>relationship to one another. It echoes how we transform matter and shape the world around us. It quantifies our ‘alienated ability’ to do things together, as a collective. Once we recognise money’s second nature, everything makes a lot more sense, for it was this collective ability that was broken. Poisoned money flowed in torrents but not into serious investments, good-quality jobs, or anything capable of reanimating capitalism’s lost animal spirits. Instead shareholders and executives bought land, empty warehouses, art, Swiss chalets, whole villages in Italy and even islands in Greece, the Caribbean and the Pacific. They collected football clubs, superyachts and, at some point, began to buy digital assets like Bitcoin or something called NFTs that they neither understood nor knew what to do with. This is how socialism for bankers and austerity for the rest of us thwarted capitalism’s dynamism, shoving it into a state of gilded stagnation. As we shall now see, cloud capital was the only pulsating, stirring force to benefit from the poisoning of money.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000158"><em>How profits became optional for the cloudalists</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000159">I remember being puzzled during the late sixties when you and Mum would sometimes diverge from your obsessive discussions about the junta – the term Greeks used for the fascist dictatorship ruining our lives – to talk about something called ‘the right’. From what I could gather, it sounded like a cross between the divine and the abominable. So I asked you: ‘What is the right, exactly?’ After your usual journey through the mists of history – describing how in the National Assembly spawned by the French Revolution in 1789, hardened revolutionaries wanting to topple the King <span aria-label="104" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg104" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and his regime sat on the left-hand side of the assembly, while the King’s supporters took the seats on the right; how later, once capitalism had been established, the right came to be identified with the interests of capitalists and a fervent opposition to organised labour or state intervention – you eventually came to the gist of what it represented in our era: ‘People on the right of politics believe that hard work aimed at private profit is the surest route to a wealthy and good society. People on the left don’t.’</p>
<p id="tec0000160">Later, I appreciated your definition better when exposed to the writings of Adam Smith, the eighteenth-century Scottish economist who is something like the patron saint of free-marketeers. Yes, factory owners driving fourteen-year-old workers into an early grave were brutish. But Smith argued that the needs of society – more and cheaper clothes, shelter, food; the stuff of prosperity – could not be met with moralisers or do-gooders. Only the capitalists’ passion for profit could provide these. Why? Because to profit, it was not enough to squeeze the living daylights out of their workers. After all, their competitors did the same. No, to steal a march on the competition, capitalists had to invest – in new machines, for example, that could cut their costs and allow them to undercut their competitors’ prices. It was in this manner, driven by the profit motive, that society would equip itself to manufacture sufficient quantities of life’s essentials and at the lowest prices possible. According to Smith, it is <em>because</em> of the capitalists’ cut-throat profit-hunger, not in spite of it, that capitalism begat wealth and progress. As he wrote in <em>The Wealth of Nations</em> (1776):</p>
<blockquote id="tec0000161">
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000162">By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to <span aria-label="105" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg105" role="doc-pagebreak"/>promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent" id="tec0000163">The crash of 1929 and the Great Depression took the shine off profit-driven markets. But throughout each of capitalism’s subsequent metamorphoses – during the New Deal, the War Economy, the era of Bretton Woods and particularly with the rise of the technostructure and the Minotaur – profit remained its driving force. Coupled with debt, profit was the power that turned the cogs and wheels of every form of capitalism the planet had seen. Until, following the events of 2008, the Global North’s central banks fell into the trap of pumping unending quantities of poisoned monies into the financial markets. Then, for the first time since capitalism had stirred two and a half centuries earlier, profit ceased to be the fuel that fired the global economy’s engine, driving investment and innovation. That role, of fuelling the economy, was taken over by central bank money.</p>
<p id="tec0000164">Profit remained the ambition of every capitalist, the goal of every vendor, the aspiration of people battling for a more comfortable life. But the accumulation of capital, the process that creates wealth by increasing the overall size of the pie, decoupled from profits, just as the end of Bretton Woods and the subsequent rise of the Minotaur had decoupled hard work from rising living standards. It was not the intention of central bankers to replace profits. They simply fell into a trap they had created for themselves. The panic of 2008 had killed off the demand for money to be invested, causing an oversupply of money that depressed interest rates. The more interest rates fell, the greater the investors’ conviction that things were so bad it would be madness to invest. And yet, trillions of dollars of central bank money continued to pour <span aria-label="106" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg106" role="doc-pagebreak"/>into finance, and so the doom-loop continued, with interest rates going further and further south: to zero or below.</p>
<p id="tec0000165">As conglomerates and governments became reliant on a diet of interest-free loans, with companies in developing countries borrowing more than their governments, in excess of $2 trillion by the end of the 2010s, the central bankers faced an ugly dilemma: either switch off the money taps, which would mean blowing up financialised capitalism, having printed all that money to save it; or continue to pump money into the system, hoping for a miracle to intervene but, in reality, facilitating the replacement of profit as capitalism’s motivating power and lubricant. Unsurprisingly, they chose the latter.</p>
<p id="tec0000166">The central banks’ anguish was the cloudalists’ delight. It was in this period that intrepid and talented entrepreneurs like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk were able to build up their super-expensive, ultra-powerful cloud capital without needing to do any of the three things that capitalists traditionally had to do to expand: borrow money from some bank, sell large portions of their business to others, or generate large profits to pay for new capital stock. Why suffer any of this when central bank money was flowing freely? And so between 2010 and 2021, the paper wealth of these two men – meaning the total price of their shares – rose from less than $10,000 million to around $200,000 billion apiece.</p>
<p id="tec0000167">To be clear, the free central bank money did not go directly to the cloudalists. It simply followed the path of least resistance. First, via the banks, it reached the managers of traditional conglomerates. Aghast at the poverty of the masses, they scorned real investment and used it to buy back their own shares. The sums involved were so vast that, like an undiscriminating tide, they lifted the price of every asset around <span aria-label="107" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg107" role="doc-pagebreak"/>them: shares, bonds, derivatives – any and every piece of paper that financiers put up for sale went up in price. No one cared whether that piece of paper would eventually turn a profit. As long as the central bank was trapped into producing new money, they knew that the trashiest piece of paper would sell for more tomorrow than it fetched yesterday.</p>
<p id="tec0000168">The financial press called it an ‘everything rally’. It went on for more than a decade. With shares in companies skyrocketing independently of whether the companies themselves turned a profit or not, the wealthy got immensely wealthier in their sleep. Then came the pandemic, giving the everything rally another almighty boost. The morning of 12 August 2020 in London, which you and I witnessed on the balcony at Aegina, was a case in point: fearing that lockdown would cause an irreversible slump in the economy, central banks did a lot more of what they had been doing since 2008: they cranked up their digital printing presses to breaking point.</p>
<p id="tec0000169">In the ensuing cacophony, terrestrial capitalists – traditional car companies, oil corporations, steel producers and the like – were happy to sit on their growing paper wealth, transforming it into real estate or other traditional assets. By contrast, cloudalists like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk acted quickly to turn their paper wealth, before it vanished, into a far greater value extractor: cloud capital.</p>
<p id="tec0000170">Both knew that profit was irrelevant. What mattered was seizing the opportunity to establish total market dominance. In 2021 Goldman Sachs, one of Wall Street’s least likeable banks, stunned the financial world by publishing a ‘Non-Profitable Technology Index’, which perfectly demonstrates capitalism’s emancipation from profits: between 2017 and the beginning of the pandemic, loss-making cloudalist companies saw their share value rise by 200 per cent. By the <span aria-label="108" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg108" role="doc-pagebreak"/>middle of the pandemic, their value had exploded to 500 per cent their 2017 level. During 2020, Amazon’s best year since its inception, when its pandemic-fuelled sales went through the roof, Bezos’s company booked sales worth €44 billion at its global headquarters in Ireland but paid exactly zero corporate tax because it posted not a cent of profits. Similarly with Tesla: even though its profit margins hovered just above zero, Tesla’s share price soared from around $90 at the beginning of 2020 to over $700 at year’s end.</p>
<p id="tec0000171">Using their appreciating shares as collateral, the cloudalists mopped up many of the billions sloshing around within the financial system. With them, they paid for server farms, fibre optic cables, artificial intelligence laboratories, gargantuan warehouses, software developers, top-notch engineers, promising start-ups and all the rest. In an environment where profit had become optional, the cloudalists seized upon the central bank money to build a new empire.</p>
<p id="tec0000172">Meanwhile, the undermining of one of capitalism’s core principles – the profit motive – had knock-on effects on the others.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000173"><em>Private inequities</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000174">Imagine Gillian, who works for a private care provider in England’s Home Counties. At some point in mid-2010, she hears that the company had been purchased by a private equity firm. She doesn’t know what private equity means and hasn’t heard of the firm that now owns her employer. But she and her co-workers are reassured that they have nothing to fear – the new management is only interested in helping the company flourish.</p>
<p id="tec0000175"><span aria-label="109" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg109" role="doc-pagebreak"/>At first, Gillian notices little difference, save the snazzier logo and some general sprucing up. However, behind the scenes, the new owners split the company into two separate companies: a care service provider, say CareCom, which employs Gillian and all the other staff who provided the care; and another company, say PropCom, that owns all of its property (its buildings, equipment, vans and so on), which then charges CareCom rent for its use.</p>
<p id="tec0000176">Before long, PropCom increases the rents it is charging CareCom and announces further steep rent increases. CareCom’s management gather together Gillian and her co-workers and, citing the increased rents, explain that unless they accept longer working hours for no extra pay, CareCom will have to be wound up. Meanwhile, using the boost in its long-term rent revenues from CareCom as collateral, PropCom takes out a large loan from a bank. Within days, the loan has become dividends in the pockets of the shareholders of the private equity firm.</p>
<p id="tec0000177">Within five years, CareCom has been wound up. After five years of rapidly worsening pay and conditions, Gillian and her fellow workers have been thrown out of work while large contracts to provide care to local communities, paid for in advance by taxpayers, have been unceremoniously dishonoured. But along with all other real estate during the ‘everything rally’, the value of PropCom has appreciated. Once PropCom’s property has been sold, the bank that lent it the money is made whole and the private equity firm keeps the rest on behalf of its investors.</p>
<p id="tec0000178">This sordid exercise has a soothing, if mystifying name: ‘dividend recapitalisation’ – though to call it that would be akin to relabelling a bank robbery as ‘asset redistribution’. The private equity firm that cost Gillian her job has practised <span aria-label="110" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg110" role="doc-pagebreak"/>straightforward asset-stripping, with financialisation providing the necessary smoke and mirrors. Looters, who have created no new value, have simply ransacked a pre-existing care provider. To use the language of early economists like Adam Smith, it is a classic case of feudal rent defeating capitalist profit; of wealth extraction by those who already have it triumphing over the creation of new wealth by entrepreneurs. And the key point to note is that the success of such a scheme depends on these looters being able to sell subsidiaries like PropCom at high enough prices once the original company has been destroyed.</p>
<p id="tec0000179">Before 2008, when capitalism still relied on profit as its motive power, it would not have been possible for such a scheme to be generalised – if it were and too many of the various PropComs went on sale at the same time, their value would fall. This is what gave Adam Smith his optimism about capitalism: his faith that capitalist profit would continue to triumph over feudal rent. In reality, since Smith wrote his famous lines in the 1770s, rent has survived and even prospered under capitalism. Cartels, consumer gouging, the technostructure’s successful manufacturing of desires for things we do not need, financialised asset-stripping – all of these practices have generated increasing rents <em>within</em> capitalism. Nevertheless, Smith’s optimism was supported by the bigger picture: rent survived only parasitically on, and in the shadows of, profit. That changed after 2008. With central bank money replacing profit as the fuel of the economy and with the ‘everything rally’ driving the price of PropCom-like subsidiaries ever upwards, private equity could take over and successfully asset-strip as many capitalist firms as it could lay its hands on all at once. And that was not all.</p>
<p id="tec0000180">Socialism for the financiers gave rise to another cluster of <span aria-label="111" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg111" role="doc-pagebreak"/>financial uber-lords to rival the cloudalists – three US companies with powers exceeding those of private equity and all terrestrial capitalists put together: BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. These three firms, the Big Three as they are known in financial circles, effectively own American capitalism. No, I am not exaggerating.</p>
<p id="tec0000181">Most people have not heard of them but they have heard of the companies the Big Three own, which include America’s major airlines (American, Delta, United Continental), much of Wall Street (JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup) and car makers such as Ford and General Motors. Together, the Big Three are the largest single shareholder in almost 90 per cent of firms listed in the New York Stock Exchange, including Apple, Microsoft, ExxonMobil, General Electric and Coca-Cola. As for the dollar value of the Big Three’s shares, it has too many zeros to mean much. At the time of writing, BlackRock manages nearly $10 trillion in investments, Vanguard $8 trillion and State Street $4 trillion. To make sense of these numbers: they are almost exactly the same as the US national income; or the sum of the national incomes of China and Japan; or the sum of the total income of the eurozone, the UK, Australia, Canada and Switzerland.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter004_en_10" id="chapter004_en10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></p>
<p id="tec0000182">How did that happen? The official version is that the Big Three’s founders spotted a gap in the financial markets: ultra-rich people and institutions wanting to be ‘passive investors’; that is, to buy shares without having to choose what they are buying, or even to choose professionals who will choose for them. To service their need for safe, mindless share purchases, the Big Three take the money of the seriously wealthy and buy literally everything – shares, to be precise, in every business listed in the New York Stock Exchange. Giving <span aria-label="112" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg112" role="doc-pagebreak"/>your money to the Big Three to buy shares on your behalf thus became equivalent to having bought a chunk not of individual companies but of the entire New York Stock Exchange!</p>
<p id="tec0000183">This could not have happened before 2008 because until then the ultra-rich simply did not have access to enough cash with which the Big Three could buy a significant chunk of the New York Stock Exchange. After 2008, however, central bank-sponsored socialism for the ultra-rich created more than enough money.<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter004_en_11" id="chapter004_en11" role="doc-noteref">11</a> Thereafter, the rise of the Big Three to such supreme financial power was almost inescapable, and now that they are there, the Big Three enjoy two insurmountable advantages: unprecedented monopoly power over entire sectors, from airlines and banking to energy and Silicon Valley;<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="notes.xhtml#chapter004_en_12" id="chapter004_en12" role="doc-noteref">12</a> and a capacity to offer the ultra-rich high returns for very low fees. These two advantages allow the Big Three to extort rents at a scale that would have made Adam Smith weep.</p>
<p id="tec0000184">I can almost hear Smith’s voice, which I imagine with a tinge of a Scottish accent, lamenting that after 2008, and in the name of saving capitalism, central banks snuffed out capitalism’s dynamism and advantage. I can imagine his dismay that harmful, quasi-feudal rent got a chance to exact a historic revenge on fruitful capitalist profit, with profit-seeking consigned to the aspirant petty bourgeois while the truly rich gleefully whisper to one another that profit is for losers. I can picture his exasperation that the treasured guardians of capitalism, such as the Fed and the Bank of England, had funded a new form of cloud capital that is today snuffing out markets and turning consumers from sovereign agents into the playthings of algorithms that lie outside of the effective control of markets, governments and perhaps even their inventors.</p>
<h3 class="HeadA" id="tec0000185"><em><span aria-label="113" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg113" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Back to your question</em></h3>
<p class="no_indent" id="tec0000186">Time for a confession. In 1993, when you posed your killer question after I had connected you to the fledgling internet, I was not up to the challenge. It had been a couple of years since the left’s greatest defeat: the collapse of what was known as really-existing socialism, from the demise of the USSR and its satellites to China’s espousal of capitalist labour markets to India’s dalliance with neoliberalism – developments that appended, within a year, more than 2 billion additional proletarians to the capitalist system. And looking back, I was perhaps too eager to clutch at any straw that might revive the prospect of a progressive alternative to capitalism. While not naive enough to ignore that capitalism had become unassailable, I did allow myself to dream improbable dreams.</p>
<p id="tec0000187">Impressed by the early internet commons, and mesmerised by a very early 3D printer I had chanced upon at an MIT laboratory, I fantasised about groups of young designers forming cooperatives using industrial-scale 3D printers to create a variety of goods – from personalised cars to made-to-order refrigerators – at a cost that did not require mass production to stay low. Such cooperatives might, I hoped, steal an advantage over the General Motors and the General Electrics of the capitalist world – that, to use the language of economists, the economies of scale that underpin the power of General Motors and General Electric would be eradicated, activating a process that would at least deplete corporate power and might perhaps pave the way towards a decent non-capitalist future.</p>
<p id="tec0000188">It was not just wishful thinking. It was a spectacular failure <span aria-label="114" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg114" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to foresee how a new form of capital, not a bunch of non-capitalist cooperatives, would grow out of the internet to turn the likes of General Motors and General Electric into shadows of their former selves. Taken in by the early internet and its market-free, decentralised nature, I fell headlong into a monumental diagnostic error.</p>
<p id="tec0000189">Assuming, wrongly, that capitalism’s only serious threat was the rise of organised labour, I missed completely the epic transformation of our times: how the privatisation of the internet commons, aided by the 2008 crisis that led central banks to open the floodgates of state money, would beget a new, super-powerful type of capital. How this cloud capital would spawn a new ruling class. How revolutionary that new ruling class would prove, leveraging its cloud capital to make almost the whole of humanity work for them, either for free or for a pittance – including many capitalists. And, crucially, what a backward step all that would prove in the grander scheme of emancipating humanity and the planet from exploitation.</p>
<p id="tec0000190">Remarkably, as with all historic transformations, no one planned it. No capitalist imagined becoming a cloudalist. No central bankers aimed at funding the cloudalists. No politicians saw the damage cloud capital would inflict upon democratic politics. In the same way that capitalism came about against the will of everyone, including the kings and bishops as well as the peasants, the rise of the cloudalists happened out of sight and behind the back of the vast majority, including the most powerful of historical agents.</p>
<p id="tec0000191">Knowing what we now know, two questions arise. The first concerns the sustainability of the cloudalists’ dominance. As I write, war in Ukraine has turbocharged the mild inflation that came in the wake of the pandemic, thus <span aria-label="115" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg115" role="doc-pagebreak"/>causing central banks to cease minting new monies. If I am right that it was central bank cash that funded the cloudalists, will cloudalist power recede as the rivers of central bank monies run dry? Could the good old capitalist conglomerates, relying on terrestrial capital, make a comeback?</p>
<p id="tec0000192">The second question, which I can imagine you putting to me forcefully, is more about language. Is life under the cloudalists’ reign fundamentally different from living under capitalism? Are the cloudalists really so different from the capitalists that we need a newfangled term – technofeudalism – for the system we live in today? Why not just call it hyper-capitalism or platform capitalism?</p>
<p id="tec0000193">These are the questions I address in the next chapter. But first, let us return for a moment to your beloved Hesiod. Besides warning us that every new age forged by some revolutionary technology yields a generation ‘who never rest from labour and sorrow by day or from perishing by night’, Hesiod also bequeathed us a crucial allegory: that of an aristocracy of gods dwelling above the clouds that encircle Mount Olympus, jealously holding on to their exorbitant power over us mortals. In describing such a world as if it were the natural and eternal order of things, Hesiod challenged humanity with a hard question, one that is as pertinent to us as it was to the Iron Age generation: can the cloud-dwelling aristocracy’s power ever be claimed by the mortals? Would we mortals know what to do with it if we got hold of it? In other words, was Prometheus a fool to steal the fire of technology from the gods? If not, what would the task of a modern Prometheus be in the Age of Cloud Capital? This is the ultimate question that I will seek to answer in the final chapter of this book.</p>
