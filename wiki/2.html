Abstract

In this commentary, we strive to illustrate common misconceptions of the dopamine fasting fad that has become popular among wellness enthusiasts and purported by health gurus. Here, we review the proposed Dopamine fasting technique for managing behavioral addictions as proposed by California psychiatrist Dr. Cameron Sepah. We first summarize correct and incorrect interpretations of what Dopamine fasting involves. Next, we contextualize the role of dopamine as it relates to behavioral modification interventions for addiction. Particularly, we discuss the role of dopamine in behavioral addiction and the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques for various addictions which are the basis of the proposed dopamine fasting technique. While we see potential for dopamine fasting to offer significant benefits to individuals, we highlight the limitation of the self-guided aspect of dopamine fasting, which could pose physical and emotional harm to individuals if the guideline is misinterpreted or misused as the sole treatment for severe disorders which require clinician input. Future studies should aim to assess not only the scientific efficacy of dopamine fasting as a potential treatment approach for behavioral addiction, but also the needs and well-being of individuals who seek self-directed treatment from popular media trends.
1 INTRODUCTION

While alcohol, tobacco, or psychoactive drugs can become addictive, addiction is not always in the form of dependency on alcohol or other substance use disorders (SUD).1 In particular, behavioral addiction, which describes uncontrollable impulses of repeating a seemingly normal activity, like emotional eating, shopping, social media, or gaming, can be equally disruptive and distressful in excess.2-4 For those who strive to manage impulsive behaviors that lead to significant impairment in their lives, California psychiatrist Dr. Cameron Sepah proposed a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based technique called dopamine fasting.4, 5 This method has been proposed to help people manage addictive behaviors by restricting impulsive engagement to ultimately promote behavioral flexibility.4 However, due to misinterpretation of its name, dopamine fasting has been widely misunderstood and inappropriately applied.4-7

Kirsty Grant, a BBC reporter, wrote an article on her 24-h experience with dopamine fasting.6 In her interpretation, it is a lifestyle trend from Silicon Valley that involves “cutting yourself off from almost all stimulation for 24 h.”6 A shocking list of things such as exercise, eating, music, and reading are prohibited in her proposed routine, and the only things that are “allowed” are walking, meditating, writing, and drinking water.6 “This day has been really difficult, the hunger and boredom have been overwhelming,” she wrote, “… I kind of feel like I'm punishing my body.”6 Similarly, James Sinka and Andrew Fleischer, two serial entrepreneurs, interpreted dopamine fasting as “complete sensory deprivation.7” In line with this understanding, the two made efforts to prevent excitement from eye contact, talking, or light stimulation.6, 7 However, in contrast to Grant's disappointment, they claimed that everyday tasks become much more enjoyable after the experience.7

In reality, neither group interpreted dopamine fasting correctly, and they are not the only ones to do so.5 Dr. Sepah points out that media portrayals are major contributors to public misunderstanding of the term,4 but other factors such as the use of the word “fasting” may have also led to misinterpretations.5 For instance, rather than reducing dopamine or avoiding all stimulation, the focus should be on reducing the impulsive behaviors that are problematic for individuals.4, 5 In “The Definitive Guide to Dopamine Fasting 2.0,” Dr. Sepah elaborates on the CBT background for the intended version of dopamine fasting and hoped that readers will better appreciate the rationale for the technique.
2 THE DOPAMINE FASTING 2.0 SCHEDULE PROPOSED BY DR. CAMERON SEPAH

In summary, Dr. Sepah recommends dopamine fasting for controlling six categories of impulsive behaviors: (1) pleasure or emotional eating, (2) Internet or gaming, (3) gambling or shopping, (4) porn or masturbation, (5) thrill or novelty seeking behaviors, and (6) recreational drug use.4 It is emphasized that abstaining from all pleasures is not the goal of dopamine fasting; instead, individuals should specifically target behaviors that cause distress, impairment to daily work or life performance, or addictiveness. 4 For each category, Dr. Sepah outlines acceptable exceptions that are important for health and unrelated to the main concern of addiction.4 Overall, it was emphasized that dopamine fasting is not specifically altering one's health state , but rather the act of restricting problematic habits by replacing them with health-promoting activities that align with individual values.4 Dr. Sepah suggests that even if individuals absolutely cannot abstain from addictive behaviors, gradually cutting back engagement with these activities during the day can still lead to behavioral flexibility to be sustained in the long run.4

It is apparent that dopamine fasting 2.0′s guidelines can highly vary between individuals and have lots of rooms for interpretation. 4 dopamine fasting emphasizes on maintaining a healthy lifestyle where pleasure is present but under control. In the common misconception of cutting out all behaviors that bring pleasure, individuals may not only receive minimal benefit but also damage their physical or emotional health. As this was a trend made popular by media, there are currently no known scientific evidences that demonstrate the effectiveness of this specific dopamine fasting guide.4 However, as it is based on CBT, it is still beneficial to examine available evidence of CBT and addiction.
3 REINFORCEMENT AND HABITUATION: ROLE OF DOPAMINE IN BEHAVIORAL ADDICTION

First, it is important to understand the role of dopamine in addictions. Initiation of voluntary behaviors partially relies on the dopamine motivation system, specifically in motivating behaviors after conditioned learning and reinforcements.8-10 In classical conditioning, a stimulus that naturally elicits a response can be paired with a neutral stimulus, resulting in the new stimulus becoming conditioned to elicit the same response as the natural stimulus.4, 11 Such conditioned association can be repeatedly reinforced by rewards, and each repetition causes specific dopamine neurons to unconditionally respond to the stimuli that reliably predict the reward.8-10 Consequently, this causes an increase in the likelihood and strength of the behavioral response.8-10 In other words, the subject is motivated to repeat a certain action in anticipation of a reward.8-10 In the case of behavioral addiction, the frequency and impulsive nature of this repetition lead to distress, interference with daily living, or an inability to cut down the behavior.2-4

As dopamine is an essential neurotransmitter, behavioral changes are a key for controlling addiction.10 Dr. Sepah applied two CBT-based techniques in his dopamine fasting guideline: stimulus control and exposure and response prevention.4 In stimulus control, access to objects that are implicated in addictions is restricted either physically (i.e., removing phone from the room) or made impossible (i.e., blocked out by software, or if the user engages in an activity incompatible to the addictive behavior). 4 In exposure and response prevention, the main goal is to expose oneself to the stimulus without engaging in the conditioned response. 4 Instead, the focus is on adjusting the user's attitude and feelings until temptation from the stimuli could no longer force them away of their daily routine. 4 In either case, the ultimate goal is to weaken the original conditioned association between the behavior and reward, also known as habituation.4 This reduces the impulsivity and allows the subject to regain flexibility of behaviors, therefore gaining control over the addiction.4
4 CURRENT EVIDENCE AND LIMITATIONS OF CBT FOR ADDICTION

Some studies on the effect of CBT in mitigating addiction show promising results.12, 13 A study found that the majority of their clients with Internet gaming disorder were able to effectively manage symptom after undergoing CBT developed for Internet addiction.13 Another study that focused on gambling addiction assessed the effectiveness of CBT involving stimulus control, where access to money is restricted.14 While the risk of relapse was similar between groups, the group undergoing money control intervention had lower risk of dropout, gambling severity, and comorbid psychopathologies.14 Another study that applied a mindfulness-action-based CBT intervention for concurrent binge eating disorder and SUD found significant improvements in symptom severity.15 Lastly, a study compared behavioral couples therapy and CBT for alcohol dependence, ultimately finding both to be effective to change drinking behavior.16

Not all studies suggest benefits. One study that applied CBT intervention to help women maintain weight loss had only 31.3% success rate among 86 participants, and success was mainly predicted by lower addiction intensity at baseline.17 Another study assessed the effect of CBT for preventing relapse upon discontinuation of antidepressant drugs in patients with remitted anxiety disorder, only to find a low success rate with one participant dying due to suicide.18, 19 The implication of withdrawal symptoms as well as the ethical aspect of short-term interventions is vital to consider prior to applying CBT techniques.19

Dr. Sepah's dopamine fasting 2.0 guideline is mainly directed to an audience group looking for self-implemented behavioral changes.4 As such, it did not emphasize the importance of consulting medical professionals prior to restricting drug use, which overlooks the risks and consequences of drug withdrawal that may not be compensated by CBT alone. In combination with the previously discussed concern of misinterpretation that could lead to harmful lifestyles, the validity of popular media trends as replacement for formal medical consultations with professionals is brought to question. Nevertheless, computer-based CBT with minimal clinical monitoring was shown to be a safe and effective approach for treatment-seeking outpatients with SUD, and that it in fact showed more benefits than clinician-delivered individual CBT.20 It may be beneficial for future research to find a safe balance of monitoring between self-guided and clinician-guided interventions.
5 CONCLUSION

As Dr. Sepah had suggested, behaviors that elicit distress, impairment, or addictiveness to the individuals should be the target for dopamine fasting.4 Instead of entirely avoiding activities involving stimulation or pleasure, the true potential benefit of this CBT-based technique is to help reduce the frequency of impulsive behavior while restoring the flexibility of healthy daily living.4 Ultimately, if dopamine fasting is applied appropriately as per the intention of Dr. Sepah without risks of harm to the user's physical and mental health, it has potential to be an effective approach that targets problematic habits and restores control over behaviors that bring pleasure to people's daily lives.4 Future studies should aim to assess the efficacy and safety of self-guided dopamine fasting or CBT-based practices in controlled settings.

<p>this is the end of fist partt of our story</p>



The dopamine fast, created by California psychiatrist Dr. Cameron Sepah, has very little to do with either fasting or dopamine. As Sepah told the New York Times, “Dopamine is just a mechanism that explains how addictions can become reinforced, and makes for a catchy title. The title’s not to be taken literally.” Unfortunately, with such a snazzy name, who could resist? This is where the misconceptions begin.
What’s the thinking behind a dopamine fast?

What Sepah intended with his dopamine fast was a method, based on cognitive behavioral therapy, by which we can become less dominated by the unhealthy stimuli — the texts, the notifications, the beeps, the rings — that accompany living in a modern, technology-centric society. Instead of automatically responding to these reward-inducing cues, which provide us with an immediate but short-lived charge, we ought to allow our brains to take breaks and reset from this potentially addictive bombardment. The idea is that by allowing ourselves to feel lonely or bored, or to find pleasures in doing simpler and more natural activities, we will regain control over our lives and be better able to address compulsive behaviors that may be interfering with our happiness.

The six compulsive behaviors he cites as behaviors that may respond to a dopamine fast are: emotional eating, excessive internet usage and gaming, gambling and shopping, porn and masturbation, thrill and novelty seeking, and recreational drugs. But he emphasizes that dopamine fasting can be used to help control any behaviors that are causing you distress or negatively affecting your life.
You can’t “fast” from a naturally occurring brain chemical

Dopamine is one of the body’s neurotransmitters, and is involved in our body’s system for reward, motivation, learning, and pleasure. While dopamine does rise in response to rewards or pleasurable activities, it doesn’t actually decrease when you avoid overstimulating activities, so a dopamine “fast” doesn’t actually lower your dopamine levels.

Unfortunately, legions of people have misinterpreted the science, as well as the entire concept of a dopamine fast. People are viewing dopamine as if it was heroin or cocaine, and are fasting in the sense of giving themselves a “tolerance break” so that the pleasures of whatever they are depriving themselves of — food, sex, human contact — will be more intense or vivid when consumed again, believing that depleted dopamine stores will have replenished themselves. Sadly, it doesn’t work that way at all.
Fasting may simply be a technique to reduce stress and engage in mindfulness-based practices

Sepah recommends that we start a fast in a way that is minimally disruptive to our lifestyles. For example, we could practice dopamine fasting from one to four hours at the end of the day (depending on work and family demands), for one weekend day (spend it outside on a Saturday or Sunday), one weekend per quarter (go on a local trip), and one week per year (go on vacation).

This all sounds sensible, if not necessarily new or groundbreaking. In fact, it sounds a lot like many mindfulness practices and good sleep hygiene, in the suggestion of no screen time before bed.

However, people are adopting ever more extreme, ascetic, and unhealthy versions of this fasting, based on misconceptions about how dopamine works in our brains. They are not eating, exercising, listening to music, socializing, talking more than necessary, and not allowing themselves to be photographed if there’s a flash (not sure if this applies to selfies).
Misunderstanding science can create maladaptive behaviors

When you think that none of this is actually lowering dopamine, it’s kind of funny! Especially since avoiding interacting with people, looking at people, and communicating with people was never part of Sepah’s original idea. Human interaction (unless it is somehow compulsive and destructive) is in the category of healthy activities that are supposed to supplant the unhealthy ones, such as surfing social media for hours each day. In essence, the dopamine fasters are depriving themselves of healthy things, for no reason, based on faulty science and a misinterpretation of a catchy title.
Taking time out for mental rejuvenation is never a bad thing, but it’s nothing new

The original intent behind the dopamine fast was to provide a rationale and suggestions for disconnecting from days of technology-driven frenzy and substituting more simple activities to help us reconnect us with ourselves and others. This idea is noble, healthy, and worthwhile, but it’s certainly not a new concept. Most religions also suggest a rest day (for example, the Jewish Sabbath) or holidays without technological distractions, so that you can reflect and reconnect with family and community, Thousands of years of meditation also suggests that a mindful approach to living reaps many health benefits.

Unfortunately, the modern wellness industry has become so lucrative that people are creating snappy titles for age-old concepts. Perhaps that is how to best categorize this fad, if only we can get its proponents to look at us or speak to us, without disturbing their dopamine levels, in order to explain this to them.


<p>this is the end of part 2 of our story</p>


A couple of weeks ago, a visiting friend refused a glass of wine and told me he was doing a “dopamine detox.” I was happy to get him a can of seltzer, but also wondered what exactly he was talking about. 

I’ve heard of “dopamine detoxes,” of course. The idea of going cold turkey on whatever is overstimulating you and becoming an addiction, from social media to a nightly drink, is trendy on TikTok and other platforms. As someone who spends a bit too much time online herself, I’ve seen plenty of headlines recommending the practice or offering firsthand accounts of successful dopamine detoxes. 


But what exactly do you do as part of a dopamine detox? And does it actually work according to the doctors and neuroscientists who understand how dopamine acts in the brain? A little digging turned up a fair number of warnings that plenty of people misunderstand the idea and can actually end up doing themselves more harm than good. 

A dopamine detox isn’t what you think it is 

To be clear, I am not dumping on my friend. He seemed happy and well, and told me his month-long pullback from his developing bad habits was helping him regain control and figure out the right way to approach activities he felt he overindulged in. By all means, if you want to take a pause from X or alcohol or whatever, you should do that. 

But how is a good old-fashioned dry-out actually different from a “dopamine detox,” and does cutting back on excess stimulation in your life actually do anything meaningful to the level of dopamine in your brain?

To answer these questions, it’s important to get clear on what exactly you mean when you say “dopamine detox.” The term was actually coined by California-based psychiatrist Dr. Cameron Sepah as a form of cognitive behavioral therapy. As a physician, Sepah understood that “dopamine fasting” was a catchy name but not a biological reality. 

“The goal of Sepah’s dopamine fasting program isn’t to deprive the brain of dopamine or lessen dopamine levels, as the name implies. In fact, Sepah is quoted in The New York Times, stating that the name of his CBT approach should not be taken literally,” explains Hope Gillette at PsychCentral. 

Sepah’s program was all about recognizing habits that might not be serving you–like too much scrolling or gambling–and consciously making them harder to engage in while simultaneously planning substitute activities. You might unplug your internet in the evenings, for example, or disable problematic accounts and then go for a walk when you feel the urge to log on. 

“Throughout this process, you’re taught how to recognize the negative feelings or experiences that make you want to engage in a specific behavior. When those feelings arise, the goal is for you to turn to a more helpful response rather than the undesired one. Over time, dopamine fasting may help break the classic conditioning response you’ve developed that’s contributed to unhelpful habits or excessive,” the PsychCentral article  continues. 

As far as I can tell, professionals seem to feel pretty warmly toward this program and see it as effective and based on solid science. 

The wrong way to do a dopamine detox 

The problem is when people rely on influencers, not mental health professionals, to get their information about dopamine detoxs. When you get your info from social media, it’s easy to think that you need to cut out basically all pleasure-giving stimuli from your life to literally reset your brain’s receptiveness to dopamine. 

That’s not at all how your brain really works, according to Peter Grinspoon, a doctor and instructor at Harvard Medical School.

“Unfortunately, legions of people have misinterpreted the science, as well as the entire concept of a dopamine fast. People are viewing dopamine as if it was heroin or cocaine, and are fasting in the sense of giving themselves a ‘tolerance break’ so that the pleasures of whatever they are depriving themselves of–food, sex, human contact–will be more intense or vivid when consumed again, believing that depleted dopamine stores will have replenished themselves. Sadly, it doesn’t work that way at all,” he cautions on Harvard Health. 

If your interpretation of a dopamine fast means withdrawing from exercise, social interaction, or hobbies that give you joy, then you’re probably doing yourself more harm than good. Cooking healthy food, seeing friends, and moving your body are all healthy things that will help you avoid unhealthy impulses, not “stimulation” to be avoided. 

“In essence, the dopamine fasters are depriving themselves of healthy things, for no reason, based on faulty science and a misinterpretation of a catchy title,” Grinspoon warns. 

So after all this, should you do a dopamine fast if you’re struggling with impulse control or overindulgence? That entirely depends on what you mean by the term. 

If you mean the targeted, expert-backed program for cutting back on specific problematic behaviors, go for it. If you mean boring yourself silly in an attempt to somehow actually influence the balance of chemicals in your brain, science suggests you’re actually doing yourself more harm than good.

<p>this is the end of part 3 of our story</p>

Dopamine fasting is the catchy name of a popular wellness fad. Your brain produces dopamine naturally, so it’s impossible to “detox” from it. But this concept can encourage new self-regulating behaviors.

Dopamine is part of your brain’s reward pathways. When you do something perceived as pleasurable, the neurotransmitter dopamine cues the brain that it should repeat that experience.

Dopamine is a part of learning and survival. It once helped humans learn about positive behaviors like reproduction, food, and comfort.

In the modern world, dopamine is often influenced by choices — like the use of alcohol, caffeine, sugar, video games, and recreational drugs.
What is a dopamine detox?

A dopamine detox is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) developed by Dr. Cameron SepahTrusted Source, a California-based psychiatrist intent on helping people manage addictive behaviors.

Sepah believes conscious restriction of addictive activities can help people become more aware of impulsive behaviors and encourage more flexible thinking.

The goal of Sepah’s dopamine fasting program isn’t to deprive the brain of dopamine or lessen dopamine levels, as the name implies. In fact, Sepah is quoted in the New York Times, stating that the name of his CBT approach should not be taken literally.

The misinterpretation of dopamine fasting has led to a popular fad of denying yourself any pleasurable experiences with the unsubstantiated belief that doing this will “reset” your brain or help lower the threshold at which you experience pleasure.
How dopamine detox is intended to work

Dopamine detox is a form of CBT, a therapeutic methodology that identifies unhelpful patterns of thinking or behaving, associates them with underlying causes, and helps you cultivate more beneficial processes.

The underlying concept is that you’re more likely to engage regularly in unhelpful behaviors if they’re pleasurable and capable of producing dopamine. This is the process that can ultimately lead to addictive behaviors or impulsive pleasure-seeking.
Dopamine doesn’t directly cause pleasure

It’s a common misconception that dopamine is responsible for the sensation of pleasure. But according to a 2016 studyTrusted Source, your pleasure response is a complex process involving multiple physiological mechanisms. In that cascade of circuitry, dopamine is the neurotransmitter that tells your brain to repeat a behavior.

Candace Kotkin-De Carvalho, a licensed social worker from Morris Plains, New Jersey, explains a true dopamine detox aims at addressing unhelpful behaviors and habits people acquire over time.

“In this type of therapy, the patient is encouraged to be aware of both positive and negative habits then is taught to build new, healthier habits in response,” she says.

According to Sepah’s personal blog, his dopamine fasting technique focuses on an approach called “stimulus control.”

It involves taking the undesired stimulus, for example, your laptop in Internet addiction, and making it difficult to access by putting it somewhere hard to reach or by installing certain programs.

Then, you deliberately engage in another activity that’s unrelated to that laptop, like going for a walk.

Throughout this process, you’re taught how to recognize the negative feelings or experiences that make you want to engage in a specific behavior. When those feelings arise, the goal is for you to turn to a more helpful response rather than the undesired one.

Over time, dopamine fasting may help break the classic conditioning response you’ve developed that’s contributed to unhelpful habits or excessive:

    gaming
    drinking
    eating
    social media or internet surfing

But coping with behavioral addictions, such as gaming disorder or internet addiction disorder, may require the support of a licensed healthcare professional.

A 2021 studyTrusted Source indicates that this CBT-based technique encourages a healthy lifestyle while reducing impulsive behaviors. But if the guidelines are misinterpreted or misused, it can affect your physical and mental health.

Further research is needed to measure the efficacy and safety of self-guided dopamine fasting compared to clinician-guided practices developed specifically for your needs.

Consider talking with a mental health professional for safe and effective guidance prior to practicing this technique.
What dopamine fasting is NOT

Sedah specifically states in his protocol that dopamine fasting isn’t:

    reducing dopamine
    avoiding all pleasure
    social isolation
    stopping exercise
    a form of meditation

Can you have too much dopamine?

Even though dopamine fasting isn’t about lowering dopamine levels, the dopamine levels in your brain do matter.

“Dopamine plays a vital role in the brain’s reward system, which regulates mood and motivation,” says Kotkin-De Carvalho. “When this system becomes imbalanced or dysregulated, it can result in various mental health issues, including depression and anxiety.”

She indicates too much dopamine in the brain may cause impulsivity and cravings, as well as poor emotional regulation which may lead to aggression.

According to Mental Health America (MHA), consistently high levels of dopamine are indicated in substance use disorder (SUD) and some cases of schizophrenia.
4 tips to help you detox from dopamine

A dopamine detox won’t decrease your natural levels of dopamine.

If you’re concerned about unhelpful habits, like excessive alcohol consumption or social media use, a dopamine detox may help decrease the behaviors associated with cravings, impulsivity, or addiction.
1. Creating barriers

Original dopamine fasting involves making an undesirable habit difficult to participate in. This can mean:

    putting something out of reach or line of sight
    making it inconvenient
    limiting time spent with others sharing the habit
    installing blocking apps and software
    giving someone else control of necessary resources, like credit cards

2. Selecting beneficial alternatives

Once you’ve made it challenging to engage in the undesired behavior, the next step is to pick an alternative experience that promotes your well-being.

Options may include things such as:

    exercise
    playing with a pet
    reading
    drawing or painting
    calling a loved one
    meditating
    volunteering

3. Understanding underlying causes

Part of dopamine detox is understanding why you want to engage in a specific activity. If your underlying feeling is boredom, for example, recognizing when you’re bored can help keep you from impulsively going to the undesired activity.

Journaling may be beneficial in emotional exploration, allowing you to recognize and put names to the feelings you experience throughout the day.
4. Seeking guidance

CBT is a psychological treatment conducted by a trained professional.

“Ideally, a dopamine detox should be carried out under the guidance and supervision of mental health professionals, who can help patients to understand the chemical processes involved and develop a more comprehensive strategy for changing their behavior,” cautions Kotkin-De Carvalho.

She adds a dopamine detox can be complicated by the symptoms of withdrawal in some cases, and working with a mental health professional can help ensure the detox is done safely and effectively.
Benefits of a dopamine detox

There are no studies supporting dopamine detox, specifically, but 2018 research does support the use of CBT as a treatment for conditions like Internet addiction.

“Through a detailed assessment process, a cognitive behavioral therapist can help the patient understand how their thoughts and behaviors may contribute negatively to their mood or motivation, then develop strategies for changing those habits,” says Kotkin-De Carvalho.

She indicates that by gaining control over behavior, you may develop improved emotional regulation and impulse control, which often translate to greater well-being and happiness.
Let’s recap

A dopamine detox is a cognitive behavioral therapy approach that encourages self-regulation of unhelpful habits.

It’s not the practice of denying yourself pleasure as a means of increasing dopamine sensitivity or lowering the amount of naturally occurring dopamine in your brain.

Following a dopamine detox under its original framework may help encourage beneficial behaviors while helping you break the cycle of impulses related to undesirable habits.

<p>this is the end of part 4 of our story</p>

he “dopamine fasting” trend currently getting attention sees people deprive themselves of pleasurable activities for a day or a week at a time. Supposedly, it helps reduce anxiety and quit bad habits. But the practice is nebulously defined, and depending on the source, a dopamine fast can be anything from limiting one’s chocolate intake to avoiding all social situations on a regular basis. But practitioners still claim to get something out of the fasts. UConn Today asked behavioral neuroscientist John Salamone to explain the science behind dopamine fasts and how they (might) work.

What is dopamine?

Dopamine is a brain chemical involved in many functions, including motivation, emotion, learning, and reinforcement. Considerable evidence indicates that dopamine is important for engaging in effort, including sustained physical effort, which of course is important for motivation.

Dopamine is also involved in mood, but the role in mood is complicated. For example, though people often attribute the pleasure induced by food or drugs to dopamine, there is evidence indicating that interfering with dopamine transmission does not alter the enjoyment people take in food, and that dopamine-antagonist drugs do not consistently block the subjectively rated euphoria induced by drugs of abuse.  Moreover, dopamine is one of the transmitters activated by stressful and aversive conditions as well.

Is intentionally avoiding rewarding but destructive habits, such as constantly looking at one’s cell phone, really a ‘dopamine fast’?

I think it is ludicrously oversimplified to call it “dopamine” fasting.  If a part of the issue is reducing the stress of constantly answering texts and emails, then one could just as well call it “cortisol fasting” (cortisol is a stress-related hormone, part of the hypothalamo/pituitary/adrenal axis of the stress response) or “adrenaline/noradrenaline fasting” or “sympathoadrenal fasting” (the sympathoadrenal axis of stress, related to increased heart rate, blood pressure, etc.)  One could also call it “locus ceruleus noradrenaline fasting,” because that is another example of a brain system activated by stress. Opiates made by our own bodies are also involved in regulating hedonic responses, so why not call it “endogenous opioid fasting”? To me it is clear that the use of the term “dopamine” is a marketing ploy, to try to link in to all the internet and popular press mythology of dopamine as the “pleasure chemical” of the brain.

What about the therapeutic value—might some people still be helped by a “dopamine fast” regimen?

There probably is some merit to the general idea of disconnecting, cutting yourself off from the internet, and reducing stimulation, in order to relax and reset. Of course, it is doubtless that there are any number of ways to do that, and the proposed “dopamine fasting” regimen does not have a monopoly on that.  The more detailed question is whether or not one intends to use this method as a formal therapy procedure; if so, then it needs to be evaluated in a controlled clinical trial, with multiple control conditions used for comparison.   For example, is it better than meditation, or exercise, or reading a book? Moreover, it is not clear that cycles of “binging” on stimuli vs. “fasting” from stimuli is the best way to modulate stimulus input. It might be better to limit texts and emails a few hours every day, rather than complete fasting on specific days. These conditions would need to be compared as well. I don’t know of any well controlled studies using the “dopamine fasting” methodology, so until that is done, “dopamine fasting” seems to be another trendy fad therapy without much empirical basis compared to other options. Uncontrolled idiosyncratic application and individual self-reports are not the way to determine if it is effective.
